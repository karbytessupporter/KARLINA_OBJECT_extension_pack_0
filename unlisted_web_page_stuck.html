<p><strong>stuck</strong></p>

<p>I once had a dream where I was wearing a white shirt and I had a very large belly and was apparently sitting on the ground of a huge lawn touching my belly with my hand and then finding that my hips were much wider and fleshier than normal and sticking out of a hole in the ground. Then the hole went from being parallel to the surface of the ground to being perpendicular to that plane such that the earth bent to create some kind of small hill which resulted in my belly and chest making contact with the ground while my wide hips were still submerged in the hill behind me. I do not think I was pregnant but there was a heavily pregnant energy to my being. I tried pushing myself out of the hole with my arms but my hips and belly were wedged tightly in place (and the dirt was impenetrable to my fingers despite the fact that the ground looked and felt like dirt which my hands could claw through). I felt seamless with the earth at the parts of me which were pressed against it or submerged in it. Even though I was stuck in that position and usually do not like being deprived of freedom, I did not seem to be too desperate to get out of that hole. Instead, I surrendered to being encased in a soft jiggly layer fat which was being held firmly in place by impenetrable whimsical dirt.</p>
