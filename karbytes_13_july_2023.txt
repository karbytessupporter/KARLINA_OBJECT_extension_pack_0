I thought that I should mention something that I do not ever remember mentioning in writing before which happened to me during my shrooms trip at approximately 10PM on 10_JUNE_2022 (and I took between 5 grams and 8 grams of dried penis envy strain psilocybin mushrooms): during the most intense part of the trip, I got some kind of horrifying message that my brain was being hijacked and reformatted by the fungus and that I would forever after (for as long as my human body lives) be a host to that hijacking parasite of a fungus which was disabling my human ego in order to usurp it and use my human body to carry out its world saving agenda. There were times during that trip in which I seriously thought that I might have been poisoned by a bad shroom that might have been laced with something that wasn't shrooms. I thought that I might have been permanently mentally and physically disabled by that poisoning and that I was getting disabled via poisoning as punishment for making fun of someone on the Internet with cerebral palsy and that I too would be relegated to the position of a cripple. I was told by sonic interference from literal thought police that I would only be taken care of and spared being harmed intentionally by people if they felt compelled to keep me alive as an invalid deserving of their mercy. I also heard someone (perhaps myself) say that people get sick of seeing each other after a while and have to subconsciously refrain from trying to kill those they no longer want to keep seeing take up their breathing space. That's why I try to hide from people and take up as little of their time, money, and attention as possible. That's why I feel safest having only myself to call home and lifelong friend. I do not intend to ever share a housing unit with another person. That's why I live outside by myself and avoid going to my legal address any more than necessary to keep my clothes clean (though I could use a public laundry mat) and to keep my hair and skin clean (though I could find alternate places to bathe). I started using my parents' Toyota Matrix as a long term storage bin for all my clothes, bicycle, and any items which I use regularly but might not want to always carry on my person. Right now that car is parked within a five minute walking distance from a childhood friend's house in Castro Valley. I intend to make that spot the car's default resting place when I am not using it to commute to work. I decided that it is good to keep that car in my posession instead of returning it to my parents until I purchase my own car (which will be fully electric).

Anyway, the point I was attempting to make with my shroom trip anecdote was the fanciful (and not necessarily true) idea that whatever is writing this note is not a human ego, but instead, an intelligent alien of a fungus which hijacked the human nervous system and encompassing human body named karbytes to implement that fungus' agenda. In other words, I might not actually be a human writing this. I might just be exploiting a human's nervous system as my vehicle in ways which look human-intended but are instead intended by the non-human fungus I am. 

I am a fungus on a mission to infect as many human hosts as I can to become one unstoppably big superorganism which prevents Earth's biosphere from dying so that I can approach immortality as closely as possible.

I decided to elaborate on that little anecdote I wrote about my shrooms trip in the previous section of this note: it could be that all that appears to exist for me (and perhaps for every other human which I perceive to be inhabiting the same universe I perceive myself as living inside of) is some kind of cybernetic being (whose physical infrastructure might be organic, inorganic, or some combination of organic and inorganic) which hallucinates the first-person subjectivity renderings of myself and perhaps of every other (or at least some) other spatially and temporally finite beings (whether they interact with me inside of the same universe simulation as me or whether they are inhabiting simulated universes which do not intersect with my universe simulation). What I am basically describing is the commonplace idea that human existence is entirely a computer simulation instead of base-level  physical reality. If that idea is true, then karbytes does not have a physical body. Instead, what that means is that karbytes has a body which is entirely comprised of software (and so is the apparently physical universe which karbytes' body plays inside of). The frogs ribbiting and crickets chirping and leaves rustling and distant traffic sounds and stars in the sky above where karbytes is sitting would also be entirely confined to a software simulation (which is reducible to binary electrical or photonic (or some other energy transmitting medium) impulses traveling across wires inside of computer circuits. That computer would be physical relative to the software that computer runs. It could be an infinite regress of infinitely many virtual machines running virtual machines in at least one direction. Where I (karbytes) am is sitting at the terminal of a digital computer (and I am typing this note into that terminal and turning it into software on the network of web servers which that terminal is in communication with). Given enough time, I expect that karbytes will eventually create a software simulation which is at least as detailed and elegant as the universe which karbytes is living inside of and which is entirely confined to that network of web servers. Maybe karbytes will make a sentient copy of itself which inhabits that simulated universe and/or karbytes will incrementally upload itself into that simulation such that karbytes effectively traverses seemingly insurmountable metaphysical barriers.
