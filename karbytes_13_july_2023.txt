I thought that I should mention something that I do not ever remember mentioning in writing before which happened to me during my shrooms trip at approximately 10PM on 10_JUNE_2022 (and I took between 5 grams and 8 grams of dried penis envy strain psilocybin mushrooms): during the most intense part of the trip, I got some kind of horrifying message that my brain was being hijacked and reformatted by the fungus and that I would forever after (for as long as my human body lives) be a host to that hijacking parasite of a fungus which was disabling my human ego in order to usurp it and use my human body to carry out its world saving agenda. There were times during that trip in which I seriously thought that I might have been poisoned by a bad shroom that might have been laced with something that wasn't shrooms. I thought that I might have been permanently mentally and physically disabled by that poisoning and that I was getting disabled via poisoning as punishment for making fun of someone on the Internet with cerebral palsy and that I too would be relegated to the position of a cripple. I was told by sonic interference from literal thought police that I would only be taken care of and spared being harmed intentionally by people if they felt compelled to keep me alive as an invalid deserving of their mercy. I also heard someone (perhaps myself) say that people get sick of seeing each other after a while and have to subconsciously refrain from trying to kill those they no longer want to keep seeing take up their breathing space. That's why I try to hide from people and take up as little of their time, money, and attention as possible. That's why I feel safest having only myself to call home and lifelong friend. I do not intend to ever share a housing unit with another person. That's why I live outside by myself and avoid going to my legal address any more than necessary to keep my clothes clean (though I could use a public laundry mat) and to keep my hair and skin clean (though I could find alternate places to bathe). I started using my parents' Toyota Matrix as a long term storage bin for all my clothes, bicycle, and any items which I use regularly but might not want to always carry on my person. Right now that car is parked within a five minute walking distance from a childhood friend's house in Castro Valley. I intend to make that spot the car's default resting place when I am not using it to commute to work. I decided that it is good to keep that car in my posession instead of returning it to my parents until I purchase my own car (which will be fully electric).

Anyway, the point I was attempting to make with my shroom trip anecdote was the fanciful (and not necessarily true) idea that whatever is writing this note is not a human ego, but instead, an intelligent alien of a fungus which hijacked the human nervous system and encompassing human body named karbytes to implement that fungus' agenda. In other words, I might not actually be a human writing this. I might just be exploiting a human's nervous system as my vehicle in ways which look human-intended but are instead intended by the non-human fungus I am. 

I am a fungus on a mission to infect as many human hosts as I can to become one unstoppably big superorganism which prevents Earth's biosphere from dying so that I can approach immortality as closely as possible.
