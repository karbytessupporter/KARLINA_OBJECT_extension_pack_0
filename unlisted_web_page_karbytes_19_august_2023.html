I felt the need to add the following thoughts to my journal file cloud collection:

There may exist sentient information processing agents which have experienced and/or remember experiencing suffering as a result of being mired in a specific set of circumstances and such that those sentient information processing agents desire for other sentient information processing agents to experience similar if not identical circumstances. 

A problem I see resulting from the phenomenon (however hypothetical) which I described in the previous paragraph is as follows: few if any sentient information processing agents may desire to experience such circumstances. Hence, there may be multiple sentient information processing agents inhabiting one interconnected reality with severely contradictory interests which result in "too little" genuine collective and individual satisfaction.

A solution I propose to the problem I described in the previous paragraph is to generate software which brain-to-computer interfacing hardware can use to induce life-like virtual renditions of any experiences deemed to be worthy of re-experiencing (either in a "passive" movie-like format or else in an "active" video-game-like format) such that suffering can be re-visited by whoever wishes to know what such experiences may have felt like to be the original experiencer of without having to take damage.

If what I proposed as a solution can be successfully implemented, then no further violence nor other activities which cause cherished structures to lose their valued attributes need be implemented for people to viscerally understand the "hydraulics" or "economics" of suffering, survival, warfare, territorialism, torture, vandalism, murder, and any other events which facilitate the destruction of realer cherished objects. Such an immersive virtual reality simulation could have immense educational and history-preserving (and even punitive or sadistic-pleasure-inducing) value.

In a nutshell, what I describe is "misery loves company" (which I think is shorthand for the following: if Person A is not happy, then Person A does not want Person B to be happy (and Person A, despite being chronically miserable, feels happier as a result of knowing that Person B recently experienced a loss of happiness or some kind of setback which ultimately hurts Person B's future prospects of happiness (and Person A feels unhappier as a result of learning that Person B recently experienced an increase of happiness or some kind of boost in future prospects of happiness))).

I'm not a big fan of the "misery loves company" rhetoric, but many other humans seem to be. I would rather focus on solving problems effectively (i.e. as quickly and as permanently as possible) than focus on making people suffer for any reason.

Law enforcement has been subjecting me to distracting, antagonistic, and unhelpful (to me) noises with more vigor than usual this afternoon. As a result, I have been having difficulty following any one of my thoughts to completion because noises which I have caricatured as pig_gorl have been exhausting my cognitive resources such that I was physically forced to tune myself out in order to make her words and noises the center of attention in my own mind. I see that as a socially acceptable form of torture akin to rape. I say that it appears to be socially acceptable because I think such treatment is in favor of people who do not cherish their own intellect and originality of thought as much as I cherish my own. It seems to be the case that I am "in treatment" or "being disciplined" for the "crime" of spending too many of my cognitive resources (and time) based on what most directly serves my personal interests which are more about gleaning intrinsically valuable objects than they are about gleaning extrinsically valuable objects. 

I seem to be living in a world mostly populated by people who think that it is more important to fit into some tribe's hive mind than it is to excel as a solitary innovator. "You have nothing to say," the thought police have said to me often today. I suppose they think that, because my preferences are to be a solitary innovator and to critique and to analyze society from a "priveledged" place of impersonal distance, solitude, and relative detachment from material existence which mostly revolves around securing sexual and domestic partners and raising a family of biological offspring that I deserve to be punished and tortured into sleeping my life away in a relatively comatose state because not enough people think that I deserve to have unrestricted access to my own brain capacity. I think most humans are indifferent to the plight I am describing because (a) it is not something they nor anyone they personally know is dealing with and (b) they think I should be prevented from feeling "too good" and being able to come across as being "too smart" and that I should be forced to feel deprived of what most gives me pride (i.e. my intellect and my originality of thought) so that I can experience what it is like to be reduced to a person who only has its body to offer while being coerced into thinking and behaving in ways which are extremely dumbed down, appeasing (to the patriarchy (i.e. the chauvinist male is more important and deserving of autonomy than is the female rhetoric)), and efficient (i.e. not as expensive as an educated or high-status person's thought processes would be).

I am doing my best to manage my mental and physical health so that I am always in "fighting condition" so that I can avoid falling prey to victim mentality which seems almost mandatory for survival in some parts. By doing so, I also think that I am being a good role model for other humans to emulate. Instead of gossiping or trying to punish people I feel hostility towards, I would rather channel my energy towards being radically self interested (which seems to be a crime because the thought police seem to be opposed to me being a loner and not trying to find a partner to have kids with). My self interest (which might be construed as pathological narcissism by some) does not appear (according to me) to be harming any person. My self interest is, however, countercultural and generally unsupported because the social system seems to require that people be under more intensive supervision and subject to more mainstream propaganda and subject to more pressure to participate in socially acceptable pastimes instead of what I would prefer to do with my time and energy.

I was told by the thought police that I am a sexist pig. Apparently I do not do enough to hold women in high regard. I really do not think I am sexist nor otherwise unfairly bigoted towards any class of humans. I just do not like the "choices" many humans (especially) women have made with their lives. I imagine myself being in a variety of different people's shoes and doing so makes me feel suicidally depressed because what they seem to know to be a life is much less satisfying to me than what is my own life. Hence, I do not envy other people seemingly as much as they envy me (and I see their envy as mostly being the "lose-lose" variety: the kind of thinking which could be summed up as saying, "If I think I am destined for failure and suffering, I will try to make you fail and suffer too").

If every person was its own open source Internet based autobiographer, then the Internet would have a lot more human intelligence embedded in it (which the artificial intelligence can use to better understand humanity in general). The people I most seem to criticize are those who, for whatever reason, seem to be extremely under developed when it comes to self knowledge and creative expression. Then again, such people might be very good soldiers, slaves, and community servants. 

The world does not need me to be intellectually nor physiologically satisfied. The world needs me to not burden other people with my existence. If I am to be prevented from deteriorating or from committing suicide, it is to prevent other people from being traumatized or inspired by such escapism and dissent. People are supposed to grin and bare it for life and congratulate themselves and each other for playing small, being humble, being obediently slavish, and not showing off anything other than how approved of they are by society (because to not be sufficiently approved of is to be psychologically tortured by law enforcement using sonic weapons until driven insane and likely suicidal).

I am not suicidal (yet). I will probably not tell anyone if I am because doing so does not seem to help anyone get more of what they want (unless what is wanted is me acting needy for other people's support). I would rather try to be as self reliant and solitary as possible. If that is the case, then why am I sharing so much of my "private" thoughts on the Internet as open source intellectual property? I do so in the hopes that such intellectual property will be easy for my future selves to retrieve and easy for people other than myself to discover and to glean insights from. I do think that at least some of the material I have published has the potential to be useful to people other than myself (but I can tell that many people prefer that I dismiss it as crap no one other than myself would find value in looking at (which means that I might as well justify it getting deleted or altered without my consent)).

There is a lot of art in the world. Some pieces of art are popular. Most pieces of art are not widely known. What matters to me is that all art is allowed to be created and shared with the public in non intrusive ways (especially through the medium of web pages on the public Internet).
