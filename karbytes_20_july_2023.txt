I noticed that other people don't seem to respect my preference to be left alone because they frequently follow me out into the remote places on the outskirts of the urban sprawl and they insist on making me pay attention by loitering in my peripheral vision and talking (which is why I am almost always listening to noise generator soundtracks via my headphones while using my laptop) to them and to get within three feet of me if that does not seem to work. It seems like all the women are required to live with a male guardian so that she can have a body guard to protect her from being intruded upon and raped. I think I come across as a bit gender ambiguous and macho (which I think helps to ward off sexual harassment). A lot of my time and energy is spent trying to not make a big fuss about what I am describing and doing my best to accomodate the invasive and disrespectful conduct of other humans while not allowing such people to coerce me into giving up too much of my life in order to accomodate their insatiable demands to be the center of attention and to take up so many finite resources that they necessarily have to inconvenience other people in order to continue enjoying things as lavishly as they do. I do not expect the people to adopt more ecologically or socially conscientuous behavior unless they are forced to against their will. I am about as "small" as I can stand but the people seem to demand that I shrink to an infinitesimally "small" size in terms of how many resources I consume and especially how many cognitive resources from the human population in general are directed towards me and my web based enterprise.

It could be that I am just fabricating a load of nonsense and these people are coicidentally trying to enjoy the same space I am. It is not rational for me to assume that I am the only person attempting to enjoy the outdoors. I will try to do a better job hiding during the day. At night it is much easier to avoid people because not very many people seem to be outside their houses at night. I do not want to make people feel forced to go where they do not want to go just to accomodate me (i.e. to give me personal space). I also understand that it is healthy to have a sense of community and to look after other people instead of to ignore them. For instance, if I or someone else sees a person in distress, it is morally correct to try to assist that person if necessary; to ask them if they need help and to call 911 if necessary. It is also morally correct to call 911 to report what looks like dangerous criminal behavior in order to protect people from getting hurt.
