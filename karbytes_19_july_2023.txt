If you are not sufficiently popular and approved of by your local society, you are at risk of dying from murder or deprivation of resources which would keep you alive to a much higher extent than you otherwise would be. In other words, if not enough people are invested in your continued upkeep, you are fighting an unhill battle (and probably losing) in order to continue surviving (especially if you are old or have severely limiting disabilities).

People are in a hypnotic and emotionally compelling trance egged on by popular media which is heavily and rather forcefully advertised to have unprotected sex without concern for the consequences. Then in places where abortion is illegal or difficult to access, many children are born from unintentional and unwanted pregnancies (and because the mothers of may not want nor have the resources to provide an adequate standard of living and proper socialization and education for those children, those children will probably end up being treated as unwanted and unfavored burdens to society and hence develop behavioral and psychological problems as a result).

The population grows, the interpersonal tensions grow, and the availability of material resources does not scale up proportionally. It is a vicious cycle which spurs people to recklessly procreate (as a compulsive response to being hyper stressed out and hyper exposed to sexual and reproductive propaganda) and to postpone haulting ecologically destructive practices in the name of Convinience and Popularity. What is not convenient and popular is likely not going to get much community support. Hence, most people obediently and nonchalantly participate in such practices so that they do not end up having to be penalized, ostracized, and neglected by society.

The fresh new (favored) batches of "blank slate" (and easy to indoctrinate) babies are shot out of their vulvic canons and relegated to the front lines of the war to keep the nation size (and individual) big, gilded, brash, and unapologetically greedy. Meanwhile, those who do not fit that human capital factory farming urbanization scheme are relegated to places where they will be hidden, then forgotten about, and then gone from this material realm.

I think that the root cause of all of human civilization's problems right now is the large scale, momentous agenda to keep environmentally destructive practices from becoming relegated to obsolesce before a relatively large number of people are killed from starvation, disease, dehydration, overheating, intentional human initiated violence, and exposure to toxins. Once those relatively "low caste" people are eliminated, then those who remain will have a little more breathing room to continue wrecking havoc on the planet with reckless abandon because such people widely believe that, now that their competition has been eliminated, they can postpone making their lifestyles and infrastructure more sustainable. The naive and undereducated and gullible and fragile children will be the first to deal with such things. The torch of responsibility is passed on to the next generation until the humans go extinct (or else some of those generations become the first to seriously make society's infrastructure and practices sustainable and ethical towards all "sufficiently" complex information processing agents).

I do not mean to be shrill, alarmist, or detrimental to any person's fun or productivity or well-being. I do think it is inevitable that my existence will stir up such sentiments, however.

What I intend to do is hardly talk and to hardly show any signs of distress (even if I think I am in mortal danger) because I want to provide an example of what it means to be a human which is exceptionally conscientious of its influence on Earth's biosphere (which encompasses all human civilization at this time). I am basically no more important and no more deserving of life than is one of the mosquitos which is swarming me and trying to suck my blood. Big or small, complex or simple, popular or unpopular, loved or hated, smart or dumb, each and every information processing agent is in an ongoing "battle" to preserve itself against the counter influences (which requires a continuous supply of energy and continuous evasion of fatal injuries and fatal diseases).

(Of course I am working hard daily to fine tune my personal survival strategies and productivity habits but from within the context of someone who wants to minimize its harmful ecological impact and to promote rugged individualism, stoicism, and a deep and passionate conquest of scientific, philosophical, creative, and experiential knowledge worth living for. The kind of utopia I fantasize about is one in which each of its inhabitants is a genius of some sort and the supporting society is socialist and technocratic with as much labor as necessary outsourced to machines while humans attempt to maximize their time, energy, and effectiveness when it comes to accomplishing their own personal goals as unique individuals and as members of supportive communities).

If you are still in this level of reality, I presume it is because you want to be at this level of reality.

I published the text in the previous section as a tweet and deleted it approximately 30 seconds later because it is not of the same caliber as the previous tweet which I published yesterday at approximately 6:58PM Pacific Standard Time:

Quantum entanglement of ions inside of quantum computer hardware can be set up such that an information exchange bidirectional (and hence N-directional) digital-to-analog-to-digital signal transmission across spatial lengths between regions of space which accelerate away from each other faster than the speed of light. Then omniscience is almost achieved!
