Today karbytes updated the web page named TRIANGLE_GRAPHING of the website named Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com at approximately 5:30PM Pacific Standard Time on 21_JULY_2023.

As part of updating TRIANGLE_GRAPHING, karbytes modified the file and web page displayed copied contents of that file named triangle_graphing.js which is linked to that web page and uploaded that JavaScript file to this GitHub repository.

Also, as part of updating TRIANGLE_GRAPHING, karbytes uploaded new screen capture images of the application user interface substantiated by the three code files whose links are highlighted black with green text displayed on that web page named TRIANGLE_GRAPHING. Those image files have also been uploaded to this GitHub repository.

karbytes also uploaded (to this GitHub repository) the following screen capture images of that software application while karbytes was debugging that application's only JavaScript file:

Earlier today karbytes published a tweet on karbytes' Twitter profile and then deleted that tweet once that tweet was no longer relevant (i.e. once the WayBack Machine stopped generated an error in response to karbytes submitting a web page URL to save in the WayBack Machine database). That tweet is depicted by the screen capture image which was uploaded to this GitHub repository:

Finally, earlier today, karbytes uploaded a screen capture of a Twitter conversation karbytes upvoted (i.e. clicked the like button for) to this GitHub repository:

I noticed that the front tire of my bicycle went flat after leaving it the yard at my mother's house. I suspect that a human did that intentionally.

I examined the flattened front tire of my bicycle and noticed one thorn embedded in the rubber. I pulled it out and went inside my mom's house (and I've been in the backyard of that property for most of this afternoon) to search for sealant. I fortunately found an unopened tube of silicone sealant in a drawer in the garage. When I went outside again I was unable to locate the hole. I proceeded to pump as much air into that flattened tire as I could using my portable bicycle tire hand powered pump to get the tire full of air. Then I screwed the tire cap back on. I see the tire is slowly leaking but the bike seems rideable. I'll keep patching up the tire holes using the silicone sealant and I'll keep using the hand pump to keep the tire inflated enough to ride. I don't think I'll need to buy a replacement tire yet.
