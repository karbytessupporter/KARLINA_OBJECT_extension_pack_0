Today karbytes updated the web page named TRIANGLE_GRAPHING of the website named Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com at approximately 5:30PM Pacific Standard Time on 21_JULY_2023.

As part of updating TRIANGLE_GRAPHING, karbytes modified the file and web page displayed copied contents of that file named triangle_graphing.js which is linked to that web page and uploaded that JavaScript file to this GitHub repository.

Also, as part of updating TRIANGLE_GRAPHING, karbytes uploaded new screen capture images of the application user interface substantiated by the three code files whose links are highlighted black with green text displayed on that web page named TRIANGLE_GRAPHING. Those image files have also been uploaded to this GitHub repository.

karbytes also uploaded (to this GitHub repository) the following screen capture images of that software application while karbytes was debugging that application's only JavaScript file:

Earlier today karbytes uploaded the following image to this GitHub repository and shared that image on karbytes' Instagram profile:

Earlier today karbytes published a tweet on karbytes' Twitter profile and then deleted that tweet once that tweet was no longer relevant (i.e. once the WayBack Machine stopped generated an error in response to karbytes submitting a web page URL to save in the WayBack Machine database). That tweet is depicted by the screen capture image which was uploaded to this GitHub repository:

Finally, earlier today, karbytes uploaded a screen capture of a Twitter conversation karbytes upvoted (i.e. clicked the like button for) to this GitHub repository:

I noticed that the front tire of my bicycle went flat after leaving it the yard at my mother's house. I suspect that a human did that intentionally.

I examined the flattened front tire of my bicycle and noticed one thorn embedded in the rubber. I pulled it out and went inside my mom's house (and I've been in the backyard of that property for most of this afternoon) to search for sealant. I fortunately found an unopened tube of silicone sealant in a drawer in the garage. When I went outside again I was unable to locate the hole. I proceeded to pump as much air into that flattened tire as I could using my portable bicycle tire hand powered pump to get the tire full of air. Then I screwed the tire cap back on. I see the tire is slowly leaking but the bike seems rideable. I'll keep patching up the tire holes using the silicone sealant and I'll keep using the hand pump to keep the tire inflated enough to ride. I don't think I'll need to buy a replacement tire yet.

The main reason why I no longer want to hang out with people nor make new friends is because a sufficiently high number of them seem to take pleasure in my suffering sufficiently frequently and sufficiently intensely. People may be surprised and dismayed that I am not more willing to put away my solitary hobbies (especially bicycling and code camping) in order to be some kind of companion animal to other humans. Humans are loud, obnoxious, domineering, sadistic, combative, drama mongering, militant pessimists, and anti individuality to a disheartening extent. Of course I do not mean to suggest that all humans are as bad as I describe. I believe plenty of humans I genuinely would enjoy the company and friendship of exist (but they are probably not the majority). I know I get accused of being elitist and bigoted. So be it. I do my best to be of service to humanity without overstepping what I think are appropriate limitations. I assume many people want me to forsake my rather iconoclastic lifestyle and to be more submissive to what those people want. They are the kind of people I imagine love saying, "It's okay not to be okay," cheerfully when they expect me to feel unhappy but they seem to get angry at me when I'm happy (which seems like them implying, "It's not okay to be okay"). Hell, even being calm and non dramatic in situations which would "cause" seemingly most others to behave more loudly, uncontrollably, and irrationally seems to be discouraged because such composure is a sign of privilege rather than relatability and humility.

These are just words and not what those words describe. It could be that what I describe is wholly or partially fiction.

Humans seem so loud and forceful when it comes to them trying to get my attention (and yet they seem so withholding of information in their demonstrated preference to be passive-aggressive, deceitful, and prolonging the perpetuation of misery instead of being more eager to mitigate it).
