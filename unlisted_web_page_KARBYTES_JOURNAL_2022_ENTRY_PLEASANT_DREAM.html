<p><strong>KARBYTES_JOURNAL_2022_ENTRY_PLEASANT_DREAM</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>Shortly after I dumped out my menstrual blood cup onto the dark forest floor outside my tent, I went to sleep and had one of the most pleasant, visually beautiful, and witty dreams I ever had in my life&#8230;</p>
<p>In the dream I opened my eyes to see that someone had removed the rain cover from my tent such that the tent resembled a glass house for raising plants. (The tent also somehow grew in size and was in the middle of some backyard to some mansion). It was shortly before sunrise and the garden was stunning. Somehow my brother appeared and we were waiting to get let into the house like two cats would. My brother seemed to know the people who lived there (and the people who lived there were apparently a person I have had a long term crush on and his parents). The backyard was extensive and looked like something from a Home and Garden infomercial. The mom was talking calmly and cheerfully on the phone as a real estate agent and seemed to know that my brother and I were there but did not look up and she went inside the giant house which had tall ceilings and beige walls with double doors leading into a ballroom. (I wonder if the fancy scene was partially a result of sleeping near the gigantic golf course which looks like part of a French castle garden). My brother and I were waiting for the guy I&#8217;ve had a crush on to wake up and come out of his room. While we waiting, we sat in one of the upstairs living room areas and played with some weird toys and watched weird television shows. One of the shows was just a giant Christmas tree ornament of a rectangular wooden thing with colorful ribbons giving it a plaid appearance. There was a laughter track which played continuously with it. My brother said that the joke was that everything about my life was about artwork. I jokingly and in a dead pan manner said, &#8220;Change the channel! I beg you!&#8221; We were just relaxing on the couches as the morning sunlight illuminated that house with expansive hallways, tall ceilings, and large windows. It was look the good old days when we were happy-go-lucky kids not in a rush to be anywhere different; like we had no worries and were just enjoying the moment.</p>
<p>Only in dreams am I able to get into an alternative state of consciousness and travel to places which would otherwise be inaccesible to me. I wonder if that guy I was waiting to see in the dream (and my brother and I too) are connected on a deeper level than just the normal universe which constitutes the place we normally meet up in waking life. Perhaps reality includes limitlessly many universes which allow people and information to be exchanged in novel ways which break the sense of there having to be a unidirectionality of time, mortality, and constraining rules of physics and sociality. In that dream, the people in it seemed to speak a nonverbal language where people could just walk into houses and be treated like guests without saying a word and without even having to make eye contact.</p>
<p>That dream was a pleasant break from the seriousness and macabre aspects of my typical waking life as of late. (Outside my tent before I went to sleep, I was treated to a sound bath of crickets chirping, coyotes singing together, and raccoons making soft cooing noises. As I write this note now at 4:06AM, I hear the raccoons walking around the forest floor in their typical pattern crunching twigs with their feet. It would make for a good <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASMR" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ASMR</a> sound track).</p>
<p>By the way, I am about 5 days into my sober streak from using marijuana. My thoughts have been clearer and my sense of lethargy has been practically nonexistent. I am not in a rush to get back on marijuana. Instead, I feel like abstaining from using it for at least a solid month (if not several months). I would rather just do shrooms and other real psychedelics to be honest. I do not like how marijuana impedes my ability to have (or at least remember) having vivid dreams like the one I just wrote about. Then again, what I love about marijuana (especially after not doing it for a while) is how it makes my waking life feel like a dream. Perhaps I will break my sober streak early and waltz in a dreamlike state through the sprawling wilderness. Perhaps I will keep up the sober streak. Either way, I intend to actually getting around to updating my primary website today.</p>
