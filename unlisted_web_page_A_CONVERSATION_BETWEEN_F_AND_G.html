<p><strong>A_CONVERSATION_BETWEEN_F_AND_G</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>At approximately 6:20PM Pacific Standard Time (on 26_JULY_2023), karbytes came up with the following ideas (expressed as a dialog between fictional persons named F and G):</p>
<p>F: &#8220;After robots replace human employees at low wage jobs and all humans are entitled to get a free college education, will there be enough job openings available for humans?&#8221;</p>
<p>G: &#8220;Yes because new jobs will be created. Quality assurance jobs will be abundant because there can seemingly never be too many humans reviewing a product or service.&#8221;</p>
<p>F: &#8220;Are you suggesting most humans will only be paid a livable wage to do &#8216;busy work&#8217; so that those people are not &#8216;too free&#8217; to use their time as they please?&#8221;</p>
<p>G: &#8220;Yes. People will essentially be forced to work or to be dependent on people who work in order to enjoy a livable income. If less than 30% of humans had jobs while the other 70% either lived on tax funded welfare or else as dependents on someone with an income, then &#8216;too many&#8217; humans would be loitering in public or atrophying on the couch in private. Forcing people to work most days of the week prevents them from falling into such depression-inducing idleness.&#8221;</p>
<p>F: &#8220;You don&#8217;t think people can manage to keep themselves productively busy without a job?&#8221;</p>
<p>G: &#8220;I think some people can but not most (though perhaps I&#8217;ll be proven wrong). I think it&#8217;s safer for every person&#8217;s benefit to assume that most people will need externally imposed rather than just internally imposed limitations in order to stay productively busy instead and to avoid falling into dysfunctional habits.&#8221;</p>

<p>karbytes wanted to add an additional thought which the dialog between F and G did not include: </p>
<p>While &#8220;on site&#8221; jobs such as being a security guard at the entrance of some building are necessarily limited in count, &#8220;remote&#8221; jobs such as software maintenance, video editing, proofreading, and writing product reviews are virtually limitless in count because the employee would supply its own office space, equipment, electricity, and Internet connection. Meanwhile, the employer could save money by keeping office space relatively small by having few &#8220;on site&#8221; employees to have to provide office space and equipment to.</p>

<p>There are some things I will probably never get to do as a result of being obstructed from doing those things by people who have the power to hack my nervous system and computational devices. For instance,  I will probably never attain deep states of bliss which some forms of dedicated meditation practice and skillful use of psychedelics may induce (but I will probably be able to get diluted forms of such experiences if I make a valiant enough effort to attain such experiences). Also, I will probably never get hired and keep a job as a full time information technology or science sector employee earning more than the minimum income considered to be a livable wage (but I probably will be able to get hired and keep a job in industries which allow me to continue existing approximately as well as I have during the past three years doing low wage, low skilled jobs such as assembly line tasks in a warehouse). </p>
<p>Many people seem to not have a problem with what I described in the previous paragraph because (a) I only seem to want to financially support myself instead of a spouse and children and (b) there almost always seems to be people who are displeased with my past or present conduct or beliefs who think I deserve to be deprived of much of what I want in life as punishment for my failure to conform adequately to those people&#8217;s ideas of what a good person is.</p>
<p>Am I depressed or angry because of what I described in the second to last paragraph? I might be to a moderate or mild extent, but apparently not nearly enough to satisfy the people who are displeased with my past or present conduct or beliefs who think I deserve to be deprived of much of what I want in life as punishment for my failure to conform adequately to those people&#8217;s ideas of what a good person is.</p>
<p>Am I afraid that my mental state or quality of life will deteriorate in the future? Yes. I am afraid that I am fighting a losing battle against those who want me to suffer more than I apparently have been and am.</p>
<p>Will I commit suicide? I doubt that I will (not just because I really would rather keep trying to find a way to derive satisfaction from my experiences, but also, because I think my tormentors want me to stay alive so that they can derive satisfaction from my dissatisfaction).</p>
<p>What else do I have to say to the public? I believe there are plenty of kind, smart, hard working, and fun people in the world who would not be opposed to me having a life I would enjoy and being able to pursue my goals without being intentionally hindered by hackers of my nervous system and technology. Those are the people I consider to be my target audience (and I consider myself to be among that group of people I would consider to be my target audience). To those who are not my target audience: I will try my best not to gossip about you nor to malign you in my digital communications nor in my thoughts nor in forms of idea expression which I do not record in a retrievable format (but I probably inevitably will think thoughts which are angry and unflattering towards you at times). I fear you and hope you will not badly hurt me. I hope we can all live in harmony and lead happy, healthy, and prosperous lives as soon as possible.</p>
