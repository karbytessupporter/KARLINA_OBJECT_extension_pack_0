<p><span style="background:#ffff00">The following <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hyperlinks</a> each lead to exactly one raw file which is part of the public <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a> repository named <a style="background: #00ff00;color: #000000" href="https://github.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_summer_2023_starter_pack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KARLINA_OBJECT_summer_2023_starter_pack</a>. The purpose of this web page is to save karbytes time and energy when saving each raw file in that GitHub repository to the <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayback_Machine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WayBack Machine</a> (as a web page which can be publicly viewed on the WayBack Machine database). karbytes intends to routinely log into its Internet Archive user account in order to access the batch save feature of the WayBack Machine (which allows karbytes to save the web pages which are linked to one directory web page which displays outgoing hyperlinks to those web pages when karbytes enters the Uniform Resource Locator (<a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL" target="_blank" rel="noopener">URL</a>) of that directory web page to the text field on the WayBack Machine save form and then clicks the SAVE button to begin saving that directory web page and the web pages which are referenced via hyperlinks on that directory web page).</span></p>
<p>Note that, for a directory web page which has more than a specific number of hyperlinks on it, the some of (but not all of) the web pages which are referenced via hyperlinks on that directory web page are saved in a "random" order during the batch WayBack Machine save operation. For that reason, <u>that directory web page will need to be saved multiple times in order to save all of the web pages which are referenced via hyperlinks on that directory web page.</u></p>
<p>Note that the aforementioned GitHub repository (which is referenced on this web page using the <span style="background:#00ff00;color:#000000">green highlighted</span> GitHub repository hyperlink in the <span style="background:#ffff00;color:#000000">yellow highlighted</span> paragraph) can be saved in the WayBack Machine as a directory web page (using the "save outlinks" feature) such that the non raw files which are in that repository are saved as WayBack Machine web pages. To be clear, using the "save outlinks" feature of the WayBack Machine, inputting a public GitHub repository URL into the WayBack Machine web page save form and then clicking the SAVE button will save that GitHub repository as a web page in the WayBack Machine database and, also, save each non raw file which is in that GitHub repository as a web page in the WayBack Machine database (unless there is an exceptionally large number of files in that GitHub repository (which means that the GitHub repository will need to be saved multiple times using the "save outlinks" feature in order to create WayBack Machine saves of all of the non raw GitHub files which are in that repository)).</p>
<p>This web page exists on the website named <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com</a> because raw files which are part of a GitHub repository are have no direct outgoing hyperlinks from the web page whose URL is the web page address of that GitHub repository.</p>
