I was hesitant to make this note because I have already amassed quite a bit of documentation about the caricature I have referred to as pig_gorl in the website section named KARBYTES_JOURNAL_2023_POST_BIRTHDAY of the section named KARBYTES_JOURNAL_2023_POST_BIRTHDAY of the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com. I decided to add this note to this repository because it adds what I think is important missing information about pig_gorl (especially why she exists). I think that she exists because she represents what might possibly be the universal and essential aspects of misogyny.

I imagine pig_gorl appearing to be a scantily clad prostitute who is neither fat nor skinny nor muscular, but instead, what most people heterosexual men would consider to be healthy and sexually attractive. I imagine she is wearing a tight dress which ends immediately where her thighs begin (such that, if the dress was shorter by a centimer, her pubic region would be exposed). Her legs are bare and she wears high heeled boots which she steps around in and swivels her hips in while making slow hypnotic movements with her lower body and more eratic looking movements with her upper body (especially arms and face) which suggests that she is having some kind of tantrum and/or psychotic breakdown. Her behaviors, speaking, and voice appear to be coming from a bratty, narcissistic, and helpless child. She's not a person whose presence brings me a sense of comfort nor companionship. Instead, her presence makes me feel anxious and ready to get baited into some kind of power struggle with her while she desperately tries to pick a fight with me and force me to make her the center of my attention, time, and money merely because she is a spoiled, demanding, high-maintenance, rude, crass, and highly erotic personality trying to seduce me into being her slave, sycophant, and abuse victim (and token villain). It is hard for me to see her as a human being. Instead, I see her as some kind of siren robot or cat which looks like a human who only cares about herself and will put on a show of insincere emotionality and caring in order to exploit whoever she can like the parasite she is. Even though she looks like she is made to get pregnant and to bare healthy offspring, I doubt she would be a good mother. Instead, I think that she would be a danger to any child or vulnerable person who is left in her custody. She acts more needy, volatile, fragile, important, and destructive than any child or disadvantaged person I have ever seen (except for violent criminals). She might as well be categorized as a violent criminal (but she seems to get treated like an innocent child who is exempt from being criminalized because of how weak, mentally unstable, emotionally expressive, fragile, ignorant, and easy to control she seems to present herself as being).

I say that pig_gorl hints at why I and other people might harbor misogynistic feelings. I do not feel misogynistic towards all women or even towards most women but I have recently been exposed to a lot of women who seem to have many of pig_gorl's defining traits. I dread having to interact with such people and know that such people thrive on trying to pick fights with other people and egging on violence because such people are intellectually underdeveloped and lacking what I consider to be decent role models. (I have noticed strikingly few women who I would consider to be decent role models especially because women tend to lack the kind of intellectual rigor, individualism, hard-nosed skepticism, and bravery I have seen in men and almost in no women. I have seen women generally be quicker to tier during debates and challenging conversations than men and when they talk they sound more like they are parroting others and laughing and smiling and excessively and being excessively and unquestioningly dogmatic when they talk which makes me lonely and want for the company of someone deeper and more intellectually developed).

I imagine that sharing this note online will make a lot of what I call "monkey people" angry and want to lash out at me with ad hominem insults and maybe even physical violence or vandalism. I will share this note publicly at the risk of being retaliated against by such "monkey people" (who I think are too ugly to mate with and too ugly to befriend). I hope and expect that this note will inspire and comfort some of its readers by giving them a refreshing break from the typical "politically correct" cultural indoctrination which encourages women (and men) to be intellectually and emotionally immature brats which reflexively cater to the "monkey man's" ego as puppets of the patriarchy. I hope that the desperate and pathetic hypersexualization and intellectually stuntedness of women stops being trendy soon and that humans will become more well-rounded, autonomous, and unapologetically egoistic instead of falling over themselves in fake humility while obnoxiously calling attention to "self care" being necessary, good, and not something to be ashamed of. The most attractive people to me do not make a big show of self care. They just do it and expect other sane people to also do it.
