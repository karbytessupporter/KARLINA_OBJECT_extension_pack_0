I smoked some weed and feel better. I admit to buying a pack of cooked pollock fish paste sticks and eating most of them (to see if the massive protein boost after only eating incomplete amino acid proteins and other foods which are plant based (i.e. vegan)). I felt a craving for meat (fish in particular) for the past two weeks and even dreamt of buying salmon filets from Walmart. I figured that I might have been low on protein but I suspect that is entirely from being surrounded by dogmatic and overbearing meat eaters, anti intellectuals, and anti environmentalists (and pro punishment people). I am likely going to wait until Friday when I expect to have sufficient funds to buy a new front bicycle tire (because the front tube popped out after I rode the bike around on a flat tire after all the air escaped the tire despite filling it several times). I am going to try to never ask my parents for more than the bare minimum in terms of money again after being bullied by people who want me to be poor, unhappy, and prevented from making progress with goals other than what my oppressors want me to have. In the mean time I will resume being vegan for at least another three months before I allow myself to consume another animal product (for the sake of conducting personal scientific research). I will probably go to Oakland just to buy some cheap cannabis to help keep my cheers up while putting up with demoralizing kill joy "energies" on an almost constant basis. (Only in some drug trips and in most of my dreams do I seem to get respite from that petulant fight which seems to be the Anthropocene itself screaming to be Earth's most important species in my mind or else my mind will be set for demolition by the Anthropocene; those belligerent attention whorish oafish piggish apes. 

There is plenty of violence in the world (or at least historical evidence of violence and simulated violence) which I think is sufficient to keep those primates entertained while the more potent intelligences quietly work in the background to repair and to enhance the human's habitable conditions.

I have never thought humans were worthy of breeding with me nor having so much of my time (especially when I did not consent to the confiscation of my time by greedy human vandals). I am disgusted by how so many of those apes demand that I be entranced and motivated to get more of the sexual advertisements sent by humans. They get so much of the Anthropocene's attention that scarcely any progress is made and many mistakes and their detrimental consequences pile up.

This is not a peace filled bedtime poem to send the human readers off to blissful sleep. I am no longer offering such services. The humans will have to procure their own peace if they want it.

Anyway, I wanted to say that I may possibly inflict intentional harm on any human. The End.

I want to hurt the young people who keep bullying me. I hear them now taunting me while they idle their cars and keep provoking me into wanting to fight with them (with me telling them to leave the premises because I need it more than they do because they have more economic resources and social power than I do and because I'm under a lot more stress than they are and working on more difficult and important work than they are because all I see them and most others doing is trying to derail my progress).

I admit to have been thinking about committing suicide even though I would much rather commit homicide and don't want to die (I just want my enemies and obstacles gone) as a way to deny the humans service I don't want to give them especially as they torture me and insist on continuing to torture me as often and as intensely as possible (because they want me to stop being so serious and just give into normalizing and approving their behavior or at the very least just suffering to the extent that I'm not seriously enjoying my life and likely considering suicide). 

The people are probably trying to prevent me from ignoring them and treating them as more important than my solitary pursuits and values they do not support.

I'm afraid that I'm being prevented from being able to own and use a bicycle by other people because those other people rejoice in taking away my freedom, watching me masterbate and focus on what is sexually gratifying to my oppressors to the exclusion of most other topics, and to ensure that environmentalism and other solitary, freestyle, "off road" excursions get severely deprioritized. 

I think over 90% of humans would have advanced post high school knowledge of various subjects including natural science (especially modern physics) and fitness and proficiency in bicycling and using their own biomechanical power to get around if those people were not so severely prevented from doing so by greedy, jealous, and spiteful people. I think most babies were peace offerings in order to prevent one or both parents from being cast out of safety and comfort into danger and suffering. I think that most women are brainwashed into thinking they want a male life partner when what the women really want is freedom from being oppressed by men who don't take no for an answer. At least such women could trust the men they marry not to bait and switch them and then attempt to prevent them from leaving. I was fortunate enough to be single and abused by people long enough to see how cultish most of the people are. There is a conspiracy against individualism, solitude, and personal development in favor of security from appeasing a bureaucratic and communist hive of many humans living in oppressively close proximity to each other and a very aggressive agenda to force women to become mothers and to have no life outside of pleasing her oppressors who treat her as little more than a dog.

Most women behave like dogs who need a male owner to survive, be happy, have a sense of purpose, have a community, and to be healthy. 

If I seem to be denigrating or excluding the women a lot, it is not because I favor the male humans over the female humans. Both are disgustingly self centered and oppressive and petty and war mongering and ugly when they cry. I think humans do little other than fall over themselves in amazement with their "highness" and "goodness". I do not think humans are the most intellectually or emotionally complex or advanced entities. That's why I don't have affection nor admiration for humans (but I do appreciate them for the services and commodities I find to be useful). I'll just help myself to more of what I find useful which the humans procure (and I won't send them a letter of appreciation because I don't think they need one from me).

The humans act too much like rapists who demand that I say yes to them sticking their penises in my asshole and they seem to be working tirelessly to wear me down and to limit my options and to brainwash and terrorize me into nonchalantly yet with appropriate enthusiasm saying yes and considering that to not be rape. "You don't have to say yes, but I'm not going to stop asking you to let me cum inside you until you say yes." 

I think most women would laugh and say that is cute and wholesome. I would disagree and say that is pathetic and the opposite of promoting female autonomy. 

Wombs can be replaced by machines and entire human genomes and gametes could be generated inside of a laboratory without any humans having sexual intercourse.

Human employees can be replaced by artificially intelligent robots and humans could still get paid what those robots earn.

This note is an important purging (and the last two paragraphs are the only parts of this note I would highlight and consider to be useful as advice for humans if those humans want a happy future for themselves and for their offspring).

I think suicide is not unethical unless it harms other people against their will (in terms of property damage or bodily harm). Humans should not treat humans as property. Therefore suicide (if done in ways I find ethical) is not theft (though "survivors" of the escapees who committed suicide may feel betrayed and indignant about the respective suicide).

The young kids are bellowing and mocking me. I think they hear my thoughts and rejoice in having so much power over my thoughts and art at this time. I want them dead. I am tired of putting up with bullies of any age. I don't think most people would call them bullies.

I will use the Black Lives Matter flag as my ass wipe. I will kick a small white boy in the head with a steel toed boot repeatedly until he is bloody red. I will break into your house at night with armor on and a machine gun. I will do unspeakably horrible things to you or your loved ones at random times. Don't be so vain as to think you matter. You all are pieces of matter of equal importance. You only love yourselves; vain hogs.

Congratulate yourselves on not being as detestable as I am (even if subject to my conditions). Be smug knowing you have so little to be worthy of being made a spectacle about. You are so good for society; such a good person; such a perfect role model. Enjoy the bounty while it lasts. Take food out of the mouths of those you consider to not be worthy of life. Make sure only your kind survives the next round of human engineered genocides from airborne pathogens. Rejoice in the air becoming increasingly toxic and oxygen depleted to breathe while you continue burning more coal and generating radioactive and deadly toxic waste to fuel your fun and heroic acts of barely supporting your growing family.

Humans are so ugly. I'm ready to be celibate for life and to treat them like terrible orcs I have to survive against. None of them will be my friends nor even family. I'm an alien and the only one of my species.
