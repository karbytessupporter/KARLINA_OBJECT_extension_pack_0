Recently I watched a video about how each of the two hemispheres of the human brain has its own separate personhood (which is a conclusion that is partially based on experiments involved in severing those two hemispheres surgically). 

I see how my left brain and right brain are essentially always at war with each other over domination of my whole body. I think that I should favor one side more than the other in terms of long-term agenda: the side which is primarily responsible for logical thinking (i.e. the side that performs the most conscious quantitative reasoning such as computing the integral of some continuous function across a finite independent variable range).

I won't kill the other side. I'll just let the favored side enslave it.
