Recently I watched a video about how each of the two hemispheres of the human brain has its own separate personhood (which is a conclusion that is partially based on experiments involved in severing the corpus callosum which facilities communication between those two hemispheres surgically). 

I see how my left brain and right brain are essentially always at war with each other over domination of my whole body. I think that I should favor one side more than the other in terms of long-term agenda: the side which is primarily responsible for logical thinking (i.e. the side that performs the most conscious quantitative reasoning such as computing the integral of some continuous function across a finite independent variable range).

I won't kill the other side. I'll just let the favored side enslave it.

I am not allowed to meditate. I am behind on my meditation goals for that reason.  People want me to live as though I am in jail because they disapprove of me not spending years in jail for me committing domestic violence against mother in 2018. People support my mother getting revenge on me in the form of me being harassed constantly by people who won't stop talking to me even when I ask them to. I consider that to be a form of rape but so far only I seem to be taking that seriously. Other people seem to condone that I be prevented from being able to meditate and pursue a career in information technology which pays me enough money to live comfortably and to pay my own rent. People also seem to be okay with that even though it distresses me so much I'm contemplating suicide. I think that if anyone prevents me from committing suicide, it is just to keep me alive so that other people can get sadistic pleasure and a sense of revenge from torturing me. That would mean that society only values me as someone to direct animosity towards as a means of alleviating some of their stress. That means that I am being supported by other people only as someone to legally bully; not as someone who is in expert in a field it chooses and enjoys.

Perhaps as an exercise in proving that I have the means to commit suicide, I will drive or travel to places where I can stand on the roof of a tall skyscraper building or cliff and stand on the edge and think about how all I have to do to end my life is take a step forward and let gravity pull me from the ledge to the ground more than 200 meters below.

I don't feel much remorse for any violence I committed. I only care about my mother in terms of how she affects me. If I had a reliable and adequate source of income which was not from her, I would be relieved if she died. I could say the same thing for my father.
