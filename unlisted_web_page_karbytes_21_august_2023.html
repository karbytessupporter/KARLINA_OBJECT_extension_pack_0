All hail the mighty "no op" gap in time (and therefore in space); freedom to remain relatively limitless and relatively uninstantiated (as an apparently unique pattern whose elements are contrasting sequences of energy densities per uniform unit of space (and perhaps also of time)).

Perhaps space and time are not the same thing.

("No op" is an abbreviated version of the term "non operation" in the context of computational instruction execution. A "no op" process occupies some finite (and therefore measurable) allocation of time and energy transferred for the purpose of implementing an algorithm codified as a particular finite sequence of the binary digits 0 and 1 (but that time and energy is used merely to "pause" the computer seemingly in order to prevent errors due to throughput interference from "too much information in too little signal bandwidth")).
