V: "As many jobs as possible should be outsourced to robots."

W: "Wouldn't that cause too many humans to lose their jobs?"

V: "The term 'too many' is subjective rather than objective like 80% is (and yes I do think that approximately 80% of the human workforce should lose their (current) jobs to robots). The 20% which does not get replaced by robots is providing a service which sufficiently many humans desire and are willing to pay for. The 80% which does get replaced by robots should be given an adequate minimum monthly income (which is a mixture of cash deposited into the recipient's bank account and vouchers used excluding for purchasing basic essential services such as housing unit rental) paid for by the tax dollars which human employees pay no more than 30% of their paychecks towards and which robot employees pay 100% of their paychecks towards (since robots do not have to eat, sleep, excrete waste, occupy housing units, consume entertainment, pursue hobbies, or travel outside of work)."

W: "That's a lot of people being forced to wait for free money to arrive while they are treated as obsolete as employees unless they update their employable skills. Also, those people would likely be very jealous of their working neighbors who can afford more expensive products and services in addition to being treated as more important and elite by humans in general. I think the robots should be prevented from taking the jobs of people are used to going to work at so-called lowly jobs. Those jobs might not be very intellectually demanding nor difficult nor even necessary for apes to perform, but such jobs give those apes a sense of pride and empowerment; a sense of being a valuable and necessary part of some larger whole."

V: "You're right. Technology should serve what most humans want. Humans are creatures of habit. Maybe all able bodied humans should be denied free money and instead be forced to work at some job so that those humans are forced to be relevant to humans who would otherwise not care about the existence of."

W: "Are you being facetious?"

V: "No. I'm attempting to represent the position which the majority of humans seem to take: yours."

W: "Are you insinuating that my position is dumb?"

V: "No. I believe you are intelligent when it comes to protecting yourself from depression as a social creature with deeply ingrained habits and beliefs. I think most people would rather keep robots from taking their jobs so that those humans do not have to adjust to a radically new lifestyle (especially if their current lifestyle is following in the footsteps of the elders and peers in the tribe which raised them). Tribal cohesion is probably the most significant factor in why a human would not want its job to be outsourced to a robot."

W: "Are you saying that single childless adults majoring in a STEM field (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) are more likely to benefit from unencumbered outsourcing of jobs to robots?"

V: "Yes. Those people seem to have more options available in terms of how they are able to interpret available information and output something useful and novel because such people tend to be more logical than emotional, more cerebral than sensual, and more methodical than reflexive. Such people concentrate their resources towards solving problems in precisely documented systematic ways instead of by merely emulating whoever they were raised by or in close and frequent physical proximity to (instead of allocating those resources towards raising offspring and courting a mate and reenacting the stereotypes which are prescribed to them via mainstream culture)."

W: "Why doesn't karbytes have a job?"

V: "karbytes is currently living entirely off allowance money from karbytes' parents while karbytes completes a web development project which is expected to be complete no later than 01_SEPTEMBER_2023. After that project is complete, karbytes tentatively plans to start searching for some kind of paid job with karbytes' goal being to maximize its free time and to maximize karbytes' income and to minimize karbytes' stress from violating karbytes' personal ethics (which largely emphasize environmental sustainability and not minimizing suffering universally)."

W: "karbytes is a bum."

V: "What do you mean by the term 'bum'?"

W: "A bum is a person who leeches off other people's hard work and sacrifices in order for that person to get the benefits of working hard and making sacrifices without actually working hard and without making sacrifices."

V: "As a human who rarely drives a gasoline powered car and who almost never consumes any food which is not entirely plant-based instead of animal-derived, karbytes ecological impact is smaller than what is considered to be average amongst the human population karbytes is a member of. Also, karbytes is very self-motivated and single-mindedly focused on projects related to sharing open source software on the World Wide Web. Given that context, it could be argued that karbytes is not more of a bum than what is considered to be average for karbytes' population."

W: "karbytes has to grow up and stop being such a picky eater and slow and stingy commuter. karbytes should give up veganisn in favor of being an omnivore so that karbytes does not need special dietary accommodations which karbytes peers are not likely to ask for. karbytes should get back to driving a normal gasoline powered car so that karbytes can get to work in less time with less effort and also be able to transport more cargo and passengers than just karbytes and what karbytes can carry on its back. In order to be retained at whatever company hires karbytes for a job, karbytes should be more willing to partake in mainstream entertainment."

V: "It is not necessary for karbytes to make any of those changes in order to get hired at a job and to keep that job. As long as karbytes lives in the San Francisco Bay Area, many jobs are available which karbytes could commute to via bicycling and riding BART trains (and karbytes could drive some but not all days in order to keep up with karbytes' sustainability standards). The jobs karbytes is likely to apply for are not jobs which require much socializing outside of work because such jobs are for busy poor people. Therefore, karbytes need not change karbytes' dietary preferences nor informational and commodities consumer habits in general in order to become or to stay employed at a job."

W: "Suppose every adult citizen gets an unconditional basic income and housing vouchers each month. Then suppose I give birth to five children. Once any one of my children grows up, will that child get its own house such that when all five of my children grow up, I get five additional houses?"

V: "I neglected to mention that I would impose a maximum upper limit of two biological offspring per parent. That is to ensure that there will be at least as much housing available as there are adult humans and to prevent the human population from growing too quickly within a biosphere which is already under severe strain and dysregulation as a result of human activity. (If that situation becomes much worse (actually, perhaps right now), I would advise that, in order to carry a pregnancy to term, the pregnant or prospectively pregnant human would need to obtain a license approving that pregnancy after passing a series of tests to determine that human's eligibility to bare and to raise offspring. Otherwise, I advise that the person be detained and forced to undergo abortion or to give its children to adoption agencies and that the person serve at least one year in jail and/or pay fines for illegal breeding)."

W: "That's disgusting and anti family! Children belong with their birth parents if not biological relatives; not people who are not biological relatives who adopt them or else in impersonal institutions such as orphanages."

V: "You brought up an excellent point for me to address. Yes I do think that children are best raised in orphanages if their biological relatives are deemed to be unfit to raise them, but even more radically, I envision a 'utopia' in which all humans are sterilized and all new humans are produced from computer optimized human genomes which are implanted into the nuclei of human stem cells which are cultivated in a computer regulated artificial womb until those zygotes develop into human infants which are mature enough to leave the womb. Then those human infants are raised in a boarding school until those humans are old enough to live on their own. Then they can live on a universal basic income in their own housing units. There would only be as many new humans created in a laboratory as the system determines is optimal for human population well-being. I do not trust biological parents to be that attuned to their family's global impact. Hence, part of my utopian vision is about abolishing the institution of family as the sole or primary means to produce and indoctrinate humans and replace it entirely by a more globally-minded, autonomy-promoting, and sustainable system of maintaining or expanding the human population size."

W: "There is something wrong with you. You talk like you're not even human."

V: "My idea is still the same idea regardless of what species of information processing agent I am. Therefore, my being human or not is irrelevant to this conversation."

W: "You're going to die alone with no one there to miss you once you're dead."

V: "I hold the position that death may or may not be the termination of my continuity of consciousness and that, following my death (if I die), I may possibly be incarnated in a new body in some new space-time continuum. Until then, I am content to live alone and I am content to remain relatively anonymous and unknown to humans other than myself. I do not require the acknowledgement and appreciation of other humans in order for me to derive satisfaction in being alive because I have plenty to do which keeps me busy and feeling satisfied; like my time is generally spent well instead of squandered on activities which do not satisfy me."

At approximately 3:42PM Pacific Standard Time (on 31_JULY_2023), karbytes came up with the following ideas (expressed as a dialog between fictional persons named S and T):

S: "When does bread turn to consciousness?"

T: "Before or after the bread is eaten by some sentient information processing agent."

S: "Does the bread become sentience or does the sentience become bread (after that bread is eaten by a sentient information processing agent)?"

T: "A panpsychic worldview holder would likely say that sentience becomes bread. A molecular biologist would likely say that the energy stored in the molecules of the bread become the energy used to fuel the electrical signal propagation across multiple synapses in the brain (of the sentient information processing agent which digests the bread) simultaneously such that an emergent property of localized consciousness occurs such that it appears to itself to be localized to that particular brain within a larger encompassing space-time continuum (which that brain assumes through deductive reasoning that it is hallucinating its own instantiation such that it hallucinates its neurons and neuronal signal propagation into existence at the same time that it hallucinates the awareness of that fact)."

S: "A sentient information processing agent does not need to hallucinate a hardware brain into existence in order to be sentient (if panpsychism is true)."

T: "A sentient information processing agent needs hardware which consumes energy in order to implement some kind of algorithmic process throughout a space-time continuum. If that sentient information processing agent does not consume bread or otherwise gain usable energy inputs, that sentient information processing agent's hardware would stop executing those algorithmic processes (including the process of brain-localized consciousness)."

S: "Perhaps that brain-localized consciousness will expand into some relatively non-localized (i.e. ubiquitous) consciousness if that hardware stops executing algorithmic processes as a result of starving to death or otherwise ceasing to function as a sentient information processing agent."

T: "Perhaps that brain-localized consciousness will cease to exist forever (and it was the only unique instance of its class throughout the entire multiverse)."

S: "If you (a) define the multiverse as being the set of all imaginable phenomena and (b) you define every imaginable phenomenon as being inevitable to physically occur (infinitely many times) throughout (infinitely) many universes (but not in each possible to imagine universe throughout the entire multiverse), then that brain-localized consciousness is both alive and dead simultaneously from the perspective of a sentient information processing agent which is cognizant of the entire multiverse."

Perhaps Elon Musk changed the Twitter logo from the turquoise silhouette of a small bird in mid chirp to a black barred depiction of the letter X in order to accomodate Muslims who dissapprove of humans drawing animals (because doing so is apparently playing God). Perhaps the logo change is closer to what I consider to be good reasoning: not using a self aware sentient information processing agent as a symbol instead of as its literal instantiation.

I condone any person attempting to (and actually succeeding at) commiting suicide for any reason and by any means other than injuring or killing some other person against that other person's will.

What's keeping some people from  attempting to kill themselves is the intrinsic experience of one's own life being worthwhile to continue investing in the continuation of (due to goal oriented reasoning).

If you feel that continuing to invest in your own survival is not sufficiently satisfying for you to call worthwhile, then I would say that you are on the precipice of committing suicide. Perhaps that is a way to prevent the biosphere from metastasizing; eliminating pathogens and keeping the components which facilitie the biosphere's survival and thrival.

Perhaps there should be mandatory maximum and minimum population count values. And machines can outsource wombed humans reluctant to give birth to humans by outputting an optimized number of humans at an optimized rate using optimized genomes and stem cells.

I have been inclined to pretend that every experience I have is the result of me desiring that particular experience to occur (according to my frame of reference and to my set of memories). I have also been inclined to pretend that not every experience I have is entirely the result of me desiring that particular experience to occur (according to my frame of reference and to my set of memories).
