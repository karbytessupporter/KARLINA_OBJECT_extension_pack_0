I felt the need to add the following thoughts to my journal file cloud collection:

There may exist sentient information processing agents which have experienced and/or remember experiencing suffering as a result of being mired in a specific set of circumstances and such that those sentient information processing agents desire for other sentient information processing agents to experience similar if not identical circumstances. 

A problem I see resulting from the phenomenon (however hypothetical) which I described in the previous paragraph is as follows: few if any sentient information processing agents may desire to experience such circumstances. Hence, there may be multiple sentient information processing agents inhabiting one interconnected reality with severely contradictory interests which result in "too little" genuine collective and individual satisfaction.

A solution I propose to the problem I described in the previous paragraph is to generate software which brain-to-computer interfacing hardware can use to induce life-like virtual renditions of any experiences deemed to be worthy of re-experiencing (either in a "passive" movie-like format or else in an "active" video-game-like format) such that suffering can be re-visited by whoever wishes to know what such experiences may have felt like to be the original experiencer of without having to take damage.

If what I proposed as a solution can be successfully implemented, then no further violence nor other activities which cause cherished structures to lose their valued attributes need be implemented for people to viscerally understand the "hydraulics" or "economics" of suffering, survival, warfare, territorialism, torture, vandalism, murder, and any other events which facilitate the destruction of realer cherished objects. Such an immersive virtual reality simulation could have immense educational and history-preserving (and even punitive or sadistic-pleasure-inducing) value.

In a nutshell, what I describe is "misery loves company" (which I think is shorthand for the following: if Person A is not happy, then Person A does not want Person B to be happy (and Person A, despite being chronically miserable, feels happier as a result of knowing that Person B recently experienced a loss of happiness or some kind of setback which ultimately hurts Person B's future prospects of happiness (and Person A feels unhappier as a result of learning that Person B recently experienced an increase of happiness or some kind of boost in future prospects of happiness))).

I'm not a big fan of the "misery loves company" rhetoric, but many other humans seem to be. I would rather focus on solving problems effectively (i.e. as quickly and as permanently as possible) than focus on making people suffer for any reason.
