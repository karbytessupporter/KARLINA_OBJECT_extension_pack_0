My tentative plan (until I finish updating the web page named RAW_GITHUB_FILES_MACRO_DIRECTORY of the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com with read-only GitHub repository micro_directory web pages) is to take BART and bike to Dublin during the day to hang out in shady parking garages and be close to public Wi-Fi and to go back to Castro Valley to sleep at night.

S: "Is there a way to keep karbytes' digital artifacts (which are encapsulated by the website named Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com and the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com) from being deleted forever?"

T: "I hypothesize that there is a way to preserve those digital artifacts forever, but my idea for doing so involves having to send those digital artifacts as digital-to-analog-to-digital electromagnetic or gravitational perturbances (as waves traveling through a relatively stationary and ubiquitous field) into a wormhole which connects too otherwise causually isolated universes. Such a transmission procedure could happen whenever the medium universe in which those digital artifacts are stored is decaying such that matter becomes too unstable to retain complex and enduring forms (for sufficiently intelligent information processing agents such as humans to consider satisfactorially complex and enduring). Those sufficiently intelligent information processing agents might also be able to send themselves through those wormholes in a way which preserves their continuity of consciousness."

R: "T is insane and S is insecure. R is focused on living in the here and now and not worrying about what is not obvious. R has an actual job and friends and family and R is quite popular. S and T are losers."

karbytes: "Thank you, all three of you, for your valuable input. I will close this forum thread to further comments."
