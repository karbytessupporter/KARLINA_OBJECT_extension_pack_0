My tentative plan (until I finish updating the web page named RAW_GITHUB_FILES_MACRO_DIRECTORY of the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com with read-only GitHub repository micro_directory web pages) is to take BART and bike to Dublin during the day to hang out in shady parking garages and be close to public Wi-Fi and to go back to Castro Valley to sleep at night.

S: "Is there a way to keep karbytes' digital artifacts (which are encapsulated by the website named Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com and the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com) from being deleted forever?"

T: "I hypothesize that there is a way to preserve those digital artifacts forever, but my idea for doing so involves having to send those digital artifacts as digital-to-analog-to-digital electromagnetic or gravitational perturbances (as waves traveling through a relatively stationary and ubiquitous field) into a wormhole which connects too otherwise causually isolated universes. Such a transmission procedure could happen whenever the medium universe in which those digital artifacts are stored is decaying such that matter becomes too unstable to retain complex and enduring forms (for sufficiently intelligent information processing agents such as humans to consider satisfactorially complex and enduring). Those sufficiently intelligent information processing agents might also be able to send themselves through those wormholes in a way which preserves their continuity of consciousness."

R: "T is insane and S is insecure. R is focused on living in the here and now and not worrying about what is not obvious. R has an actual job and friends and family and R is quite popular. S and T are losers."

karbytes: "Thank you, all three of you, for your valuable input. I will close this forum thread to further comments."

The thought police told me that some people want me to be locked away in a mental hospital and forgotten about by the world outside of that mental hospital and treated by everyone as a lost cause and as someone who should be kept alive for research purposes only but not someone who should be allowed to pursue intellectual or career interests. A lot of people seem to be "on board" with that idea because (a) it makes my existence cost almost nothing compared to what it currently does and possibly will in the future and (b) because many people simply don't like me and don't want my ideas and brand and physicality popping up in their "news feed" or "view port".

Many other people seem to believe that it is morally wrong for any adult to be as willfully unengaged in other people's lives as I am. I have been told by other people to stop advertising my ideas and presence to other people so much because not enough people are interested in what I have to communicate or to channel "my" resources towards accomplishing. (I put the word my in quotations in the previous sentence because I think that many people have been insinuating that I do not deserve to be treated as having ownership of anything because (a) too many people with political power do not want me to have ownership of anything and (b) too many people in general do not think I have met the prerequisites for earning back ownership of things I previously appeared to have ownership of such as my body, mind, and property which I purchased with money).

Writing these thoughts felt necessary. I am also using my SOUND_TRACK_LOOPER single page web application to play sound tracks I made depicting an abused girl who sounds sweet but who is treated like garbage because listening to it calms my nerves and is a way of compartmentalizing my consciousness into a part which is relatively priveledged in his ivory tower of an office sipping coffee and working on his laptop in relative contentment while the other part is a socially isolated, ostracized, publicly humiliated, physically exhausted, physically harmed (but no one but her seems to care), scammed scapegoat who is tortured to an obscene extent and barraged with propaganda repeatedly that she is nothing more than an abusive whore who deserves to be forced into sex trafficking and all the dangers which come from it and that she will never get to enjoy what that ivory tower component of me gets to.

I believe that person should engage in whatever little imagination role play games work to help that person cope with the stressors of their life. I believe I am part of a global and diverse community of avid technology enthusiasts who love using and sharing open source software and open source digital media and making the world a kinder, healthier, freer, and more intelligent place not via force but via the (relatively free) flow of information and democratic and decentralized distribution of informational resources, money, and physical commodities. That's not much of an imagination game as far as I can tell. Let me elaborate...

I feel some kind of "divine" calling to be a bastion of what the open source science and technology enthusiasts are generally about because of my background and current interests. I do make a big deal about being "rooted" in the San Francisco Bay Area of California of North America because that place seems to have everything I need to pursue my dream careeer and/or hobbies. The only component of my lifestyle puzzle I do not have properly installed yet is a reliable source of monetary income. I expect to be getting a job within the next three months. I am trying not to rush the process because I want to maximize my chances of getting a job which satisfies my personal requirements so that I can make what I think is reasonable and (as optimal as possible) progress towards my goals (which pertain to maintaining my ideal lifestyle and increasing my knowledge, experience, and proficiency in the domains I am most interested in instead of merely becoming an "expert" at whatever I am forced to spend a lot of time doing for the sake of survival in an oppressive situation).
