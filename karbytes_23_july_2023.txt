My tentative plan (until I finish updating the web page named RAW_GITHUB_FILES_MACRO_DIRECTORY of the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com with read-only GitHub repository micro_directory web pages) is to take BART and bike to Dublin during the day to hang out in shady parking garages and be close to public Wi-Fi and to go back to Castro Valley to sleep at night.
