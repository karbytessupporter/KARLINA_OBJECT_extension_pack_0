Today karbytes ordered a multi-speed adult mountain bike for approximately $90 (not including taxes) to pick up in the Pleasanton Walmart store (and karbytes has 4 days to pick it up before the item is released back into the market).

Today karbytes called the Trek bicycle shop in Castro Valley on the phone and asked them if they assemble pre-assembled bikes from Walmart. The store employee who answered the phone asked me if the bike to assemble is a one-speed or else a multi-speed bicycle. I said that it was a multi-speed bicycle. Then he looked up how much the service cost would be and when the service would be expected to be complete. The service would be $103 and the service will take a few days because there are multiple service orders ahead of me. 

Earlier today I left most of the contents of my backpack in my room at home so that i could fit some or all of the pre-assembled bike in my backpack.

At approximately 2PM Pacific Standard Time, karbytes picked up its bicycle order from the Pleasanton Walmart, placed it in a large shopping cart, pushed the cart to the parking lot, put the cart in the shopping cart queue, and removed the big box with the partially assembled bicycle in it. Then karbytes carried it to the southwest side of the store and took a photograph of the box in front of the Walmart sign in the background with karbytes' Samsung Galaxy Android phone. karbytes named that image file bike_in_a_box_05_july_2023.jpg and uploaded that image to the public GitHub repository where this note (i.e. karbytes_05_july_2023.txt) is located and also to karbytes' Instagram account (which is a public Instagram account).

Between 4PM and 2:30PM on 05_JULY_2023, karbytes manually carried the box containing the bicycle from the Pleasanton Walmart store to the East Dublin BART station and boarded a train with it. Then karbytes rode the train to Castro Valley and then manually carried that box to the Trek bicycle shop in Castro Village. For approximately $70, karbytes was able to pay for the bike in the box to be assembled. The shop clerk said that the bike would likely be ready in two hours. Now karbytes is thinking about making its next major purchase a bicycle trailer and picking it up in store. karbytes can then use that bicycle trailer (for less than $200 without accounting for taxes) to purchase at least one additional bicycle from Walmart and haul it using the bicycle trailer and functional bike to the Trek bicycle shop to have that pre-assembled bicycle also set up there. At the very least, karbytes is coming up with a system for (probabilistically speaking) never being without a bicycle nor the means to transport relatively bulky cargo which is impractical to carry by hand using a bicycle trailer.
