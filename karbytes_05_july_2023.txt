Today karbytes ordered a multi-speed adult mountain bike for approximately $90 (not including taxes) to pick up in the Pleasanton Walmart store (and karbytes has 4 days to pick it up before the item is released back into the market).

Today karbytes called the Trek bicycle shop in Castro Valley on the phone and asked them if they assemble pre-assembled bikes from Walmart. The store employee who answered the phone asked me if the bike to assemble is a one-speed or else a multi-speed bicycle. I said that it was a multi-speed bicycle. Then he looked up how much the service cost would be and when the service would be expected to be complete. The service would be $103 and the service will take a few days because there are multiple service orders ahead of me. 

Earlier today I left most of the contents of my backpack in my room at home so that i could fit some or all of the pre-assembled bike in my backpack.
