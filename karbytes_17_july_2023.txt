After I rode my bicycle back to the place where I left my batteries to charge at the outdoor electrical wall outlet, I predicted that the battery with a functional display (the other battery has a cracked display which does not display any recognizable number) would display that it is 66% charged to capacity. I was right! I wonder if the brain hackers already knew exactly how full my battery was and they subliminally suggested the number to me (and even subliminally suggested the thoughts that lead to me deciding to make a game of guessing what the battery percentage was) so that I would get the opportunity to experience the brief succession of emotions (and their related thoughts) as I looked at that battery. I remember, for a fraction of a second, feeling skeptical and a bit dissappointed by seeing the exact number I predicted because, during that brief flurry of thoughts which transpired so quickly I could not even assign words to them during that brief flash of multiple thoughts simultaneously, I had the thought that the government was playing some kind of trick on me by rigging me and/or my battery to fit the narrative that I have "divine powers" of guessing the exact battery percentage (helped by the fact that my batteries are charging at a church). I know how foolish this sounds. I just wanted to share these rather silly thoughts because I think they are a clue "bigger" things which are going on "behind the scenes" or "underneath the surface". No I do not believe that it is very astounding that I guessed the exact percentage. After all, only 101 different values (integers from 0 to 100 endpoints included) were possible to display (and I have trained myself to be quite good at predicting how much time elapses and I am very familiar with how my battery operates (and it charges at slightly differing rates depending on which outlet I use (and I know approximately how much my laptop and my phone each drain my battery in terms of percentage drop per minute))). I also wanted to say 666 when I said 66. Tonight I feel that my brain is exploding with a lot of different thoughts (which is quite pleasurable). It feels like my mind as a cosmic intelligence channel is extra wide open tonight and I am noticing more synchronities than usual. I am starting to get the sense that the things which I observe occuring in my environment seem to be happening in a way which makes philosophical sense to me (which I admit sounds quite self centered (and I admit to feeling like the center of my universe and perhaps the only person fabricating it while everything else occurring inside of it is just a very complex non playable character which is not as alive as I am or which is actually a facet of what I am and we are literally all aspects of my mind)).

I am having the (perceptive and cognitive) experience right now that literally nothing I am aware of (in my short term or else in my long term memory) are "out of place". I have no sense of "foreign objects" intruding upon my sense of self and home. In other words, I have no genuine feelings of xenophobia. I feel like everything belongs inside me (and I am the universe).

After I got back to my current default camping spot, I decided to append this note with some thoughts I had while bicycling: I was thinking about how I think humans are probably the happiest animals on Planet Earth because they seem to be the species which has the most to live for. I was thinking that the other animals are probably not nearly as happy because (a) they have simpler brains and hence less intricate things to think about and (b) because they seem to have much harder lives within harsher circumstances which reduces their lives to a nonstop stressful struggle to obtain food, shelter, and the once-in a-lifetime chances to mate. Then I saw a cat calmly sitting in the middle of the road as I rode by and the cat was positioned at a slightly higher elevation than me. I then thought that perhaps domestic cats could possibly be almost as happy as humans (and maybe even happier) because the cats have the humans favor (entire lucrative industries and cultural phenomena exist around practically worshipping cats and providing them free provisions for those cats' survival and comfort) and because I notices that most cats seem to have the freedom to wander outside the home without a leash, without a cage restricting their explorations to a relatively small area, and without a human having to supervise them at all times. Also, (most) cats have the ability to survive in the wild due to their hunting instincts which enable them to hunt for birds, mice, and other small creatures. I cannot say any of those things for domestic dogs. That is why I cannot justify owning a dog. At my current stage of development, I think that owning a dog is cruel to the dog because the dog would essentially be my prisoner and slave. Also, I feel sorry for domestic dogs because they have been bred to be completely helplessly dependent on humans for survival. I doubt that many species of domesticated dogs have retained the instincts of their wolf ancestors which would enable them to know what to do without a human owner. As I was bicycling I thought about how not all cats have the ability to survive in the wild; especially kittens. I remembered a small and annoying kitten with a collar on and a name tag on it which said "Tucker" from the time I was staying in a room for rent in a two story house in Merced while I was attending school there in the fall of 2008. That kitten appeared to have no human owners and kept coming back to my house. That was partially my fault because I used chicken as bait to lure the kitten off the street and into my house so that I could take care of it. I got annoyed at the kitten because it was very demanding of my attention but I bought the kitten cat food and aspired to take care of it. Unfortunately, the Chinese landlord of that house was opposed to any pets being kept in that house. Hence, I felt obliged to quickly get rid of the cat. What I did was put the cat in my car and drove a few miles away from that house to place him near a field where I let it wander off into the grass. Then I drove away. A few days later, the owners of that cat (who were neighbors living across the street) returned from vacation and were upset that they could not find their cat. I don't remember the details of what happened but I think I notified them that I found their cat and thought it was abandoned and that my landlord forbid anyone from keeping pets in the house so I released the cat into the wild. What would I have done differently if the same situation happened? I probably would have brought the cat to an animal shelter and told the staff that I found an abandoned kitten which I was not allowed to keep at my current residence so the cat would at least have a chance of being adopted before being euthanized (and I think euthanization would be a lot less painful than dying of starvation, being hunted by a predator, or getting hit by a car).

The latest interpretation of pig_gorl I have is as follows: she no longer is mimicking a stereotypical female prostitute. Instead she is pretending to emulate me but in a mockingly derogatory way (and she seems to be embodying a "manic pixie girl" trope who has too high pitched a voice for me to assume is chromosomally or hormonally male). What I think she is trying to insinuate is that transsexualism is buffoonary and should not be attempted. Also, I think she is insinuating that I should immediately rush to get a job as quickly as possible so that I have the means to provide for my basic survival needs in terms of food, clothes, phone, bicycle and public transportation. The only jobs which seem to be quick someone like her or I to obtain (and without having to go through drug testing, physician examinations, and lengthy criminal background checks) is a low-ranking fast food job or low-ranking retail job. I told pig_gorl that she can go on Indeed dot Com and apply for such jobs and that she need not have more than a high school diploma (which I assume she has) in order to get such a job. I don't think pig_gorl is as comfortable being alone and unemployed as I am. I am not pig_gorl. I am a nerdy and physically tough outdoorsy person who thrives in solitude and who has a rather time consuming web development project to work on which I think will take up to three weeks to complete (and that project is populating the section named RAW_GITHUB_FILES_MACRO_DIRECTORY of the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com). I suppose pig_gorl, those who created her, and those who agree with her underlying intentions are opposed to me taking up so much space in public instead of being relegated to some relatively confined area (and opposed to me having so little externally imposed behavior restrictions placed on me instead of having to be more heavily supervised, forced to engage with other people (and many of them random strangers who walk in and use me as an emotional punching bag or therapist) in a perpetually upbeat and agreeable manner, and forced to make slower progress on personal projects and academic and technical certification). I imagine that, if I do what pig_gorl seems to want by taking  a low-ranking customer service job instead of waiting to get a job which suits my preferences better, pig_gorl will complain that I am not allowed to do anything but be a dumbed down and supplicant basic bitch who is forced to make engaging with people face-to-face the center of her life. I would rather make technology the center of my life. I think there is more interesting stuff for me to think about if I make technology the center of my life instead of making socializing with bimbos the center of my life. (I don't mean to denigrate customer service employees nor to insinuate that such people are not able to make significant progress towards things I would want to make my goals in life. I just want to make it clear that I am not as much of a "people person" who is desperate for the politically conservative establishment's approval as I think many political conservatives want me to be. I am not as desperate to get off unemployment and to put on a dress and to fawn over babies and to put my camping gear away as those people seem to want me to be).

To be succinct, what I currently think is "the path of least resistance" for me is, while unemployed and while working on my current website expansion project, is to go to Dublin during the day time (using my bicycle and the BART train) and to go to Castro Valley (using my bicycle and the BART train) to sleep, shower, and wash clothes. I don't have to expend as much time and energy in Dublin/Pleasanton as I seem to in Castro Valley in order to replenish my water reserves, replenish my electricity reserves, and to access the Internet. Castro Valley seems to be an oasis for those who are not young urban professionals and for those who have children, are children, or who are considered to be seniors. I would hide at my mom's house but pig_gorl and some of the next door neighbors seem to antagonize me whenever I go there. I would go to my dad's house but the Internet at that location is too unreliable to be considered adequate for my needs. (Pete's Coffee is the only place in Castro Valley which I know to offer decent 24 hour public Wi-Fi). There are several spots in Dublin which seem to have okay 24 hour public Wi-Fi though I do have to evade security guards in order to do so which is not that difficult because there are sufficient hiding places that are not dirty.

What I find particularly annoying about going to Dublin/Pleasanton via BART train is having to put up with loud and disrespectful attention whores on the trains who also often leave behind clouds of second hand cigarette smoke for other riders to breathe (and having to inhale those carcinogenic fumes gives me nausea and a headache).

Well, I cannot help but sound elitist. Oh well. I give up trying to sound politically correct. I give up trying not to offend people. I think it's inevitable that I always will offend someone just by doing the only thing I can in each moment.

If a woman does not want to get pregnant and if that woman is not using a reliable form of birth control, then that woman should not have sexual intercourse with a man. Otherwise, if that woman becomes pregnant contrary to her wishes, she may end up demanding to make abortion more commonplace than it really could be (and hence normalizing women being irresponsible, impulsive slaves to the patriarchy by being rewarded for appearing to be too histrionic to plan ahead to avoid such costly emergencies which could otherwise be avoided with a modicum more foresight and proactive action on her part).

If a woman cannot afford childcare or else the means to be a stay at home mother, then that woman should not have kids. Otherwise, if that woman becomes pregnant and gives birth to offspring, that woman is a leech on society and so are her children whose mental and physical health are undermined due to the mother being too cheap and stressed out to provide her own children a decent standard of living (and she hence perpetuates poverty, criminality, and ecological degradation as a consequence of her irresponsible decision making).

I am sick of women behaving like parasitic prostitutes and wolves in sheep's clothing. What I mean by that is that I am disgusted by the prevalence of women behaving like conniving and impulsive opportunists who use sex and reproduction as a means to escape poverty and ostracization. 

I am sick of single poor mothers being lauded as heros when what they appear to me are selfish pigs exploiting their children as "get out of jail free" cards and then acting indignant that their "plan" isn't working. They seem to imply that getting pregnant is something they have no power to avoid as though it's some kind of disability they deserve government money for. Stray cats are spayed for a reason. I would have such whores detained and forced to undergo tubal litigaion before being released back into the wild and only let those with college degrees breed.

One last thing: my detrimental ecological impact is probably less than 5% of what a typical American adult's is. These web server updates I make hardly cost any energy or money compared to those who routinely make cryptocurrency exchanges, drive a petroleum powered car, and eat beef which isn't lab cultured meat (though going plant based or even just abstaining from eating meat would cost the least in terms of environmental impact and animal welfare). I think it's disgraceful that so many humans have the means to mitigate their harmful ecological impact and their harmful impact on animal welfare but they lazily and greedily choose not to. So many of them seem quick and desperate to avoid the subject and to use ad hominem attacks and other non sequiturs such as "shut the fuck up" instead of replying with articulate, well researched, logical, and solutions oriented responses to what I say. In a way I am boycotting most forms of human interaction until the quality of human discourse improves to my liking. I am also boycotting rewarding women for dressing and behaving like prostitutes. I do not expect very many humans to follow suit with my previous sentence because the prominent flaunting of tits and ass seems to be what moves the most money and cognitive resources in the human realm. Yuck! How ugly, gross, and pathetic to sell or to buy that trash. 

Ladies, if you don't want to be treated like mere animals, behave more like rational human adults which do not waste their brain power. Otherwise, I feel justified in treating you like irrational monkeys which lack the capacities for long term planning and complex analytical thinking. I think that ignoring you until you behave more like rational, intelligent, and self sovereign men is good for everyone because doing so de-incentivizes you from continuing to pander to the swaggering, thuggish, chauvinist knuckle dragger men who would impregnate you and not support you financially unless you are a bitch at his feet sucking his cock and pathetically whimpering his name as though he were some kind of god.

After spending some time in Dublin/Pleasanton today, I got a good taste of what pig_gorl is like in this region: more obnoxious and cauterwauling and angry than she seems to be in Castro Valley. Even if she's not at the forefront of my consciousness her meddling presence is so caustic and grating on my nerves that I feel myself getting more stressed out and having a shorter attention span than I should and, hence, more compelled to spend money on things which seem to provide temporary relief to feeling heckled by a ghetto trash whore who throws a fit nonstop over me having a higher caliber of consciousness and physical health than she has been duped or coerced into settling for. I imagine she has thin arching eyebrows which look perpetually angry and haughty, big sneering pouty lips, clothing which makes her look like a 1980's mannequin with a cinched waste and an accentuated butt, lazy slow and minimalist movements which always seem compulsively and sexually charged, and her voice chatters nonstop with a tone which sounds perpetually irritated, passive aggressive, cauterwauling like a yowling cat at times and falsetto whimpering at other times, and just generally acting like an annoying fat piece of shit blocking the tubes that I cannot help but want to euthanize.
