After I rode my bicycle back to the place where I left my batteries to charge at the outdoor electrical wall outlet, I predicted that the battery with a functional display (the other battery has a cracked display which does not display any recognizable number) would display that it is 66% charged to capacity. I was right! I wonder if the brain hackers already knew exactly how full my battery was and they subliminally suggested the number to me (and even subliminally suggested the thoughts that lead to me deciding to make a game of guessing what the battery percentage was) so that I would get the opportunity to experience the brief succession of emotions (and their related thoughts) as I looked at that battery. I remember, for a fraction of a second, feeling skeptical and a bit dissappointed by seeing the exact number I predicted because, during that brief flurry of thoughts which transpired so quickly I could not even assign words to them during that brief flash of multiple thoughts simultaneously, I had the thought that the government was playing some kind of trick on me by rigging me and/or my battery to fit the narrative that I have "divine powers" of guessing the exact battery percentage (helped by the fact that my batteries are charging at a church). I know how foolish this sounds. I just wanted to share these rather silly thoughts because I think they are a clue "bigger" things which are going on "behind the scenes" or "underneath the surface". No I do not believe that it is very astounding that I guessed the exact percentage. After all, only 101 different values were possible to display (and I have trained myself to be quite good at predicting how much time elapses and I am very familiar with how my battery operates (and it charges at slightly differing rates depending on which outlet I use (and I know approximately how much my laptop and my phone each drain my battery in terms of percentage drop per minute))). I also wanted to say 666 when I said 66. Tonight I feel that my brain is exploding with a lot of different thoughts (which is quite pleasurable). It feels like my mind as a cosmic intelligence channel is extra wide open tonight and I am noticing more synchronities than usual. I am starting to get the sense that the things which I observe occuring in my environment seem to be happening in a way which makes philosophical sense to me (which I admit sounds quite self centered (and I admit to feeling like the center of my universe and perhaps the only person fabricating it while everything else occurring inside of it is just a very complex non playable character which is not as alive as I am or which is actually a facet of what I am and we are literally all aspects of my mind)).

I am having the (perceptive and cognitive) experience right now that literally nothing I am aware of (in my short term or else in my long term memory) are "out of place". I have no sense of "foreign objects" intruding upon my sense of self and home. In other words, I have no genuine feelings of xenophobia. I feel like everything belongs inside me (and I am the universe).
