Today I created a new file named karbytes_for_life_blog_updates.txt in the GitHub repository which contains this file. That new file currently logs updates I have made to the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com such as adding a new section of that website named RAW_GITHUB_FILES_MACRO_DIRECTORY and two directory web pages within that section named raw_github_files_directory_KARLINA_OBJECT_summer_2023_starter_pack and raw_github_files_directory_MINDS_2020_SCREENSHOTS. (I intend to add more of such directory web pages; one per every public GitHub which pertains to a portion of the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com).
  Today I took a photograph with my Samsung Galaxy phone (with Android operating system) and named that image honey_bee_lavender_dublin_california_14_july_2023.jpg and uploaded that image to the GitHub repository which contains this file and I shared that image as an image post on my public Instagram account.

  Today I applied for a software quality assurance job (which did not require much more than a high school diploma) for a company named Cognizant in Mountain View (and the job is a contract job paying approximately $23 per hour and is a full-time day job involved in quality testing self-driving car software and related technical documentation). Right now, I am considering limiting my job searching to jobs which involve software and information technology (i.e. jobs which could be classified as Information Technology sector jobs because that is what I am most interested in and what I have aspired to make my domain of expertise for at least a decade).
