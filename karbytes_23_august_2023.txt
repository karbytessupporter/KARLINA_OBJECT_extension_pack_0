approximately 8 hours ago i talked to ajp on the phone for approximately ten minutes about what each of us was doing with our lives the past few weeks' span. ajp called my phone at 4am apparently on accident (according to ajp). i called his phone at approximately 9am and did not get a response and, like him, i left no voice mail. i called ajp back in the evening twice and he did not respond. then he called me and i picked up the phone and we talked.

i felt a crushing pang of missing sed tonight. sed was my closest friend (but perhaps i idealized a lot).

i take pride in being single, celibate, and hermetic long term (i.e. for a period spanning at least three consecutive months). i intend for that to continue indefinitely into the future.

for a period of approximately six consecutive years, sed and i slept together almost every night and were "like two peas in a pod" often times. one night i had a disturbing and sad dream about being in a car with sed while that car was parked in front of an underground train station in san francisco which blew up due to a bomb and cement fragmants of the building landed on top of  the car and hit sed's head; thereby rendering him brain damaged and only able to make incoherent sounds. 

when i woke up from that dream my eyes were open and staring at a green light emitting diode light being reflected from the desktop computer to the glass table top. that dream happened to be when i felt some kind of loss of sed which just grew from that point as an insurmountable gap. i do not know whether or not sed is being held captive against his will or brainwashed into hiding from me (and unfollowing me on linkedin and blocking my cell phone number from his phone).
