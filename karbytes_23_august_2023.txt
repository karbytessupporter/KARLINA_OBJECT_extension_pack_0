approximately 8 hours ago i talked to ajp on the phone for approximately ten minutes about what each of us was doing with our lives the past few weeks' span. ajp called my phone at 4am apparently on accident (according to ajp). i called his phone at approximately 9am and did not get a response and, like him, i left no voice mail. i called ajp back in the evening twice and he did not respond. then he called me and i picked up the phone and we talked.

i felt a crushing pang of missing sed tonight. sed was my closest friend (but perhaps i idealized a lot).

i take pride in being single, celibate, and hermetic long term (i.e. for a period spanning at least three consecutive months).
