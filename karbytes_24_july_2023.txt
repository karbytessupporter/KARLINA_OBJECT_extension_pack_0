On 24_JULY_2023 at approximately 1:30PM Pacific Standard Time, karbytes re-tweeted and re-minded the social media post with a follow-up social media post as follows:

re-published social media post:

Quantum entanglement of ions inside of quantum computer hardware can be set up such that an information exchange bidirectional (and hence N-directional) digital-to-analog-to-digital signal transmission across spatial lengths between regions of space which accelerate away from each other faster than the speed of light. Then omniscience is almost achieved! 

new social media post commenting on the re-published social media post:

It is hypothesized that it is possible for quantum signal transmission between two computers to occur instantaneously (even if those two computers are traveling away from each other faster than the speed of light due to expansion of space-time) if those computers contain ions which are in quantum entanglement with each other (such that, when computer A updates its ion, computer B updates its ion (given that those two ions are in quantum entanglement with each other)).

I feel a bit awkward about telling other people that I have a preferred set of pronouns to be called by those people. It seems like me attempting to exert too much control over other people's thoughts and speech. Hence, I will not "correct" people if they call me a pronoun or name which I do not like to be referred to as. If someone asks me what my preferred pronouns are I will say that I have none and that I do not mind being called karbytes or any other name. I am not sure whether I will ever get to a point in my life where people assume I am male but I intend to keep presenting myself as a man in terms of clothing and behavior (but I think I might not be manly enough according to the mainstream to be considered a real man). Some people think I should simply be referred to as a woman. Some people think that I am ashamed to be a woman because of how I was educated. Some people might think I am trying to use testosterone and other markers of manliness to achieve more than I would otherwise in the domains of interest I am interested in succeeding in. I would say that the previous sentence is the most accurate of all the sentences in this paragraph.
