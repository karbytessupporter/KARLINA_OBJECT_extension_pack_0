I was thinking about being able to design and implement my own relatively small gated community of adult humans who neither have children nor pets nor plan to have children or pets. Only community members would be allowed to enter that community's mostly underground campus. Each community member is granted its own dormitory room (but community members are welcome to spend any length of time in another community member's dormitory with that other community member's permission). Community members each have on-campus jobs or classes which focus on environmental sustainability, scientific research, optimizing technology, and experimental art forms. Community members do not own cars, but they do have free 24 hour transportation in the form of self driving taxis which charge entirely from photovoltaic charging stations and which use state of the art algorithms and machine learning to minimize commute times, hazards to the passenger, and vehicle energy expidenture and vehicle damage. The community produces more than enough 100% pollution free electricity from photovoltaics, geothermal, and ocean waves to power the community and to donate surplus electricity to neighboring municipalities. The community uses vertical indoor precision calibrated farming to produce more than enough pesticide free and animal cruelty free food and other plant-derived material commodities to sustain every member of that community (and surplus commodities are donated to needy people outside the bounds of the community). 

Basically, the "utopia" I described sounds like a place which would protect and nurture the kind of culture I want to live in and to promote as superior to all other alternatives which presently exist or which were remembered by humans to exist. Because there are no pregnant women, no children, and generally no disabled people in that community (and every community member must demonstrate a higher than average proficiency and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics in order to be granted membership into that community), my fellow community members and I can focus on our work without having to be interrupted by those who hinder more than help us get our work done and making it as high quality work as possible. There are almost zero incidents of physical violence, psychological abuse, economic abuse, theft, vandalism, fraud, and other frankly "outdated" adaptation strategies occuring within that community. The people in that community are noticeably more personally developed, conscientuous, innovative, academically rigorous, and diplomatic than are the comparatively degenerate humans living elsewhere. That's because they greatly prioritize quality of human life and integrity of individual character over mere quantity of human capital. Communication amongst members of that community is almost entirely unencumbered by censorship and by paywalls. The community feels more like a giant collaborative research facility than a high school. The values in that community are very permissive of personal expression (and there is very little micromanagement because each community member is too engrossed in meaningful (and not just token) and effortful activities to have time and energy for much else). The people in that community exemplify autonomy, systems thinking, innovation, and transparency of information. The community exists in order to minimize how much time and energy each community member "wastes" on relatively basic and non-negotiable maintenance and upgrade functions such as provisioning food, medical care, transportation, housing, and access to equipment (and no corners are cut when it comes to eliminating and not just reducing pollution and the destruction of natural biomes). The entire community is designed to keep all of its citizens alive and safe during in the event of some kind of global catastrophe such as uninhabitable climate conditions, exposure to environmental toxins (including radiation from nuclear bombs), viral pandemics, and rioting related to a shortage of basic commodities. The community will not allow any non community members entrance into the campus if it issues a lock down order (and any community members which happen to be outside the campus when that lock down starts will not be allowed back inside for the duration of that lockdown). Community members generally agree that is fair and beneficial to the community because it does not favor individuals at the expense of the entire community (and it strives to remain as unentagled as possible with societies beyond the confines of that "utopia" because those societies are assumed to be too dysfunctional and disorderly to be considered sufficiently modern and utopia-like by most members of my hypothetical community).

Many community members are strongly considering creating a new division of the campus for generating optimized and arbitrarily diverse human genomes and stem cells whose nuclei contain that genetic material. Then no more than twenty and no fewer than five of such stem cells per every five years are selected to become human zygotes which are incubated for approximately nine months in artificial wombs. Then those "test tube babies" are placed in a nursery and later in a boarding school until those children are legal adults. 

The community I described is not a haven for the poor, sick, illiterate, and needy. Such people are suffering from problems which my community did not create. Such people seem to be living in a savage, violent, impoverished, deceit-filled, overcrowded, unsanitary cesspool. My community prefers to let those comparatively primitive and unsophisticated and difficult to work with people handle their own affairs instead of us acting as their intervening savior (because that would dilute our focus and cause entropy within our relatively closed system to increase beyond what we have deemed to be optimal to stay "cutting edge" instead of regressing into appeasing intellectually incompetent masses). What my community would do to help the world outside of the community is publish open source documentation and periodicals  about what is being cultivated inside that community on the World Wide Web so that other people can benefit from the labor my community does and, if they choose to, follow in our lead.
