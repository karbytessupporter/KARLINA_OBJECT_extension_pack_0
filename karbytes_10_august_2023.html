After taking two cannabis pills and drinking a delicious large hot coffee from the nearby cafe, I started working on updating the largest section of the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com while listening to various sounds through my over-ear headphones such as my SOUND_TRACK_LOOPER application and a video about "finding pockets of reducibility" and trying to computationally model the entire "network" of timelines throughout all of nature. Then I got some ideas which seemed to be an emergent property of all my sensory inputs and of my internal biochemistry and electromagnetism "messages". I imagined that what I often look like (which some people may call "information overload" but what I call "widening the aperture of cognitive and perceptual throughput") is a microphone connected to an applifier which picked up a small squeaking sound and then amplified the loudness of that sound through a recursive process of amplifier noise being picked up by the microphone and that microphone sending that input information to be sent back out into the air as sound waves from those incoming electrical firings which encode sound waves.

When the amplifier noises "get too loud", people might want to turn the power switch of that system off to reset it. I have been fighting against my ego getting reset after it "works so hard" to evolve itself into a badass.

Perhaps the most honest description of my sexuality is autosexual or autophilic. I basically find myself to be the most physically and perhaps mentally attractive person I know. That seems to "go against nature" (i.e. human society in some parts) because I am supposed to be motivated to sexually reproduce with some human I am not a close genetic relative of. Thanks to the power of modern technology, I can make indefinitely many genetic (and perhaps memetic) clones of myself. I do not feel the need to physically do that, however, just because it is physically possible. I prefer to channel all of my resources towards just a few goals which can be summed up in one word: AUTONOMY.

I have considered since the year 2020 (particularly while or after the time I worked as a full-time production associate at the Tesla factory in Fremont) making a web page on the website named Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com named AUTONOMY, but since then, I decided that the web page named AGENCY would suffice even more effectively for the same purpose.

I look forward to revising and refining my personal dialect more and more as I age. Then again, I feel a strong need to "mask" my most "down to the core" authentically karbytes "dialect" (and I really meant my own English-to-object-oriented-programming-language symbolic (text based) language). The purpose of such "masking" is to protect my core processes from getting impeded by observers.

While bicycling yesterday, I remember thinking about how one gram of water (in liquid form), occupies approximately exactly one cubic millimeter of space. #metric #water #quantities
