After taking two cannabis pills and drinking a delicious large hot coffee from the nearby cafe, I started working on updating the largest section of the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com while listening to various sounds through my over-ear headphones such as my SOUND_TRACK_LOOPER application and a video about "finding pockets of reducibility" and trying to computationally model the entire "network" of timelines throughout all of nature. Then I got some ideas which seemed to be an emergent property of all my sensory inputs and of my internal biochemistry and electromagnetism "messages". I imagined that what I often look like (which some people may call "information overload" but what I call "widening the aperture of cognitive and perceptual throughput") is a microphone connected to an amplifier which picked up a small squeaking sound and then amplified the loudness of that sound through a recursive process of amplifier noise being picked up by the microphone and that microphone sending that input information to be sent back out into the air as sound waves from those incoming electrical firings which encode sound waves.

When the amplifier noises "get too loud", people might want to turn the power switch of that system in order to reset it (and stop that loud noise which was caused by feedback amplification loop). I have been fighting against my ego getting reset after it "works so hard" to evolve itself into a badass.

Perhaps the most honest description of my sexuality is autosexual or autophilic. I basically find myself to be the most physically and perhaps mentally attractive person I know. That seems to "go against nature" (i.e. human society in some parts) because I am supposed to be motivated to sexually reproduce with some human I am not a close genetic relative of. Thanks to the power of modern technology, I can make indefinitely many genetic (and perhaps memetic) clones of myself. I do not feel the need to physically do that, however, just because it is physically possible. I prefer to channel all of my resources towards just a few goals which can be summed up in one word: AUTONOMY.

I have considered since the year 2020 (particularly while or after the time I worked as a full-time production associate at the Tesla factory in Fremont) making a web page on the website named Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com named AUTONOMY, but since then, I decided that the web page named AGENCY would suffice even more effectively for the same purpose.

I look forward to revising and refining my personal dialect more and more as I age. Then again, I feel a strong need to "mask" my most "down to the core" authentically karbytes "dialect" (and I really meant my own English-to-object-oriented-programming-language symbolic (text based) language). The purpose of such "masking" is to protect my core processes from getting impeded by observers.

While bicycling two days ago, I remember thinking about how one gram of water (in liquid form), occupies approximately one cubic center of space (and the volume of that cube would be approximately one milliliter). #metric #water #quantities

"... The mass of one cubic centimetre of water at 3.98 Â°C (the temperature at which it attains its maximum density) is almost equal to one gram..." 

The quoted text in the previous paragraph was copied from the Wikipedia page at the following Uniform Resource Locator:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_centimetre

I did not want to make any further modifications to the web page named karbytes_11_august_2023 on the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com because I like how that web page ends with a hyperlink to a concise and politically neutral article about how water at its thickest density (which is approximately 3.98 Celsius) occupies approximately one cubic centimeter, has a volume of approximately one milliliter, and has a mass of approximately one gram. I think that is an ingeniously elegant way to standardize physical quantities using a relatively stable and universal physical reference point. 

I wanted to add some ideas to this plain-text file which are not related to the metric system nor to natural science in general.

While riding the BART train back to Castro Valley after spending a few days in Dublin/Pleasanton, inhaling enough car pollution to make my throat sore, and getting my black duck-billed hat (which I originally found and picked up in the middle of the intersection between Redwood Road and Protor Road) stolen from me last night (seemingly by people who did not want me to have it because it made me fit in too much with the local aesthetic and/or it made men jealous of how I seemed to be attracting more attention from women lately because I am starting to look quite hot as a dude and those stout, red-faced, booze-filled little pigs wanted to prevent me from getting more of that kind of attention than them), I was reading some news articles on my phone and was inspired by what I read about how some people believe taxation is theft to write the following paragraph:

Perhaps government employees and agencies should be disbanded and/or made into private companies which do not pay taxes and which only stay in business if they are sustained by enough customers willing to pay for those companies products and services. Get rid of presidents and, instead, let everyone vote with their dollar and data through the instrument of capitalism and decentralized informal idea sharing. Then those who survive and thrive would be those who make themselves sufficiently useful and insufficiently harmful to their society while those who do not end up perishing from a lack of investment from their fellow humans. That lack of automatic childcare and disability support would disincentivize people from indiscriminately breeding and using their children or disability status as a way to get "free" provisions. The kids could either be left to die or else confiscated from their incompetent caregivers to be placed in orphanages and then from there either left to be raised inside the system until adulthood or else sold to the highest and most eligible bidder. Even better, stealth nanobots could selectively render humans sterile so that only the eligible and willing can breed.

I decided to modify the aforementioned web page whose content is approximately identical to the content in the file named karbytes_11_august_2023.txt because doing so helps to make my worldview and agenda more accessible.

Personally, I am glad that I have gotten to and still am relying on tax funded services such as Medical (which pays for almost all of my doctor visits, medical exams, and prescription medications) and Bay Area Rapid Transit (which I still pay approximately as much for in train fare as I would in gasoline for traveling by car the same distance but, unlike driving a privately owned vehicle, BART train riders like me do not directly pay for BART infrastructure maintenance and upgrades). But in order to curb economic inflation due to discrepancies between the availability of material commodities and the demand for such things, I think socialism may need to be replaced by libertarianism (which means there would be fewer if any "free" commodities provided by "the government" using tax dollars which were deducted from working people's paychecks but perhaps there would instead be more robust and economically transparent private providers of commodities).
