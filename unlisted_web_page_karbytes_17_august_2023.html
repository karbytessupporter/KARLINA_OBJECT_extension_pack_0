I discovered and downloaded a compilation video of samples taken out of various black metal songs which were apparently released in the year 2020 a few months ago but apparently did not make a reference to it in any of my prior notes. I decided to look up that video again and share the relevant details. I think that compilation is the best music I have in my collection at the moment. Eventually I will download some more but probably not before I am done getting the macro directory web page up to date (and I think I am within 24 hours of completing that task). Once I am done with that task, I will share the news via a new blog post (perhaps with another hand-drawn certificate of completion) and share the news on my social media accounts.
