i will get helmet as soon as possible (which i left at home or near it).

so far the most ergonomically efficient position i know of to work outdoors on my laptop is laying in my sleeping bag on my belly. (never mind. my wrist circulation gets cut off. i'll just have to keep getting creative with the positions. cross legged is my favorite but my shoulders are hunched forward often).

i plan on getting a paid job within the next three months.
