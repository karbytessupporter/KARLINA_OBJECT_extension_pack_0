Today I think that I made a breakthrough in how I handle the meddling interference which I have referred to many times throughout the blogging website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com and associated GitHub repositories: while buying some coffee this afternoon from a cafe and sitting for approximately ten minutes in there listening to the energetic and upbeat music and enjoying the cool and clean-smelling air conditioned air and insulation from outdoor noises and other stimuli inside of that building (and scrolling through my Instagram feed), pig_gorl was not at the forefront of my awareness and, what felt like the first time in years, I felt at peace in the world and not under seige from annoying and depression mongering sonic harassment from a perpetually angry and lazy sounding brat trying to pick fights with me with distracting and antagonistic noises. After I walked out of the cafe I felt that my parasympathetic nervous system had the chance to calm down such that I felt normal for a few minutes (but eventually the sense that I was under seige from pig_gorl returned). 

The breakthrough I am talking about is internally telling pig_gorl to get her own body and that my body is not her body. For some reason, that thought helped "unhook" me from the very uncomfortable feeling that pig_gorl was trying to use my body as her puppet to express her emotions (especially via vocalizations, mouth movements, and breathing). 

I imagine that pig_gorl is a fertile woman between 20 and 40 years of age with a large ass, wide hips, big breasts, and a very young-looking face and childish-sounding voice who behaves as though she has chronic premenstrual syndrome and is always sulking, pouting, whining, making sarcastic vocalizations, and acting simulataneously lethargic, horny, embittered, fiesty, and not at all in the mood to sit down and quietly study (or even to have an honest discussion with me about what is bothering her because every utterance she makes seems to be a non sequitir and almost always some kind of happiness sabotaging message towards me in particular). My physical build and personality contrasts with hers sharply (and long term exposure to testosterone injections seems to be helping to make that contrast increasingly noticeable).

What I decided to do pragmatically that I have not felt ready to do until this afternoon is stop talking to her out loud (and to stop talking unless I am either speaking to another person or else recording myself talking or singing). For the past five years I have gotten into the habit of talking to myself out loud (and at length) as a means to cope with feeling victimized and socially unsupported. Over the past week I have been spending a lot of time contemplating how commonplace it is for a human individual to feel like a sealed vessel who is held in contempt by other people or otherwise victimized by specific other people or by society in general. I have observed and read about other non human animals recently and have come to believe that perpetual conflict over territory, food, and mating opportunities is very commonplace among sentient animals such as birds, primates, and felines (and humans seem to be divided into two major groups: those who study evolutionary biology and anthropology and are genuinely interested in being more civilized and humane than human predecessors and humans who act like marginalized and abused victims of human-perpetuated injustice who can do little more than fight for survival in a harsh and cruel universe). I would say that pig_gorl is defintely of that latter camp while I believe I am a member of the former being attacked by pig_gorl for wanting to be in that camp instead of in hers.

So I am no longer using my body as her puppet to cathartically act out pig_gorl's half-baked thoughts and emotions. I have "unhooked" from her such that I no longer feel so much like a host to the parasite she is while she "pulls my strings" and coerces me into moving and speaking on her behalf. I am no longer giving her refuge in my body. After this note, I do not plan on ever again giving her attention via my blogging platform. She will have to find a new host or get her own body. Until then, I imagine she will be hovering around like an unhappy and impatient colicky infant of a newly wed bride demanding to be taken into some human host's body as that human's dependent while she wears a little tiarra and sits on an ornate throne-like reclining couch mooing and touching her swollen hips like a beached pregnant whale in distress.
