<p><strong>A_CONVERSATION_BETWEEN_A_AND_B</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>At approximately 11:44PM Pacific Standard Time (on 24_JULY_2023), karbytes came up with the following ideas (expressed as a dialog between fictional persons named A and B):</p>
<p>A: &#8220;Sometimes in our quest to preserve our cherished possessions, we forget to enjoy the present moment (which is the only place we get to appreciate that which we are trying to preserve). Eventually all things disintegrate and hence stop existing. Therefore, we should not get so obsessed in preserving our valued possessions that we neglect to enjoy those things while they last.&#8221;</p>
<p>B: &#8220;I do not believe that objects are necessarily doomed to become obliterated after they exist for some finite length of time. I believe that anything (our continuity of selves as conscious and localized partitions of nature which are not omniscient) has the potential to be preserved for an indefinitely long length of time. Hence, rather than not keep trying to preserve myself and my valued possessions, I will keep trying to preserve such things. Even if I do not succeed at making those things last for an infinitely long period of time, I get satisfaction from attempting to find a way to.&#8221;</p>
<p>A: &#8220;Your approach to life sounds exhausting and expensive in terms of energy expidenture. I would rather minimize how much energy I use in favor of maximizing my ease and comfort.&#8221;</p>
<p>B: &#8220;We clearly have differing preferences when it comes to energy expidenture. I error on the side of dying of exhaustion (or working so hard I am too tired and sore to enjoy the present moment while zealously pursuing a future which I believe is worth all that labor and suffering). Otherwise, I am afraid I would default to being too much of a mere animal instead of a technologically advanced human. Animals on Planet Earth which are not human seem to only expend enough energy to stay alive and to procure and raise offspring. They seem to allocate almost zero energy towards developing technologies or cultural artifacts like the humans have. (Perhaps the humans did something to ensure that only the humans would become the only technologically and culturally advanced species on Planet Earth).&#8221;</p>
<p>A: &#8220;My dog doesn&#8217;t seem to mind not being able to read or be an entrepreneur. My dog seems happy just staying confined to my house or on a leash with me escorting it where I want it to go. My dog seems to relish in the simple pleasures in life without having any existential crises. I think my dog sets a good example for how humans ought to be more like.&#8221;</p>
<p>B: &#8220;Your dog probably would not be able to hunt as well as wolves and coyotes could if you released it into the wild. Your dog was bred by humans to have traits which the humans found pleasing to humans and such that the dog became extremely loyal to and dependent on humans for survival. I would rather not promote being in that kind of dominance hierarchy as an adult human.&#8221;</p>
<p>A: &#8220;The dogs are happier living with humans than their wild ancestors were living in the wild independently of humans. Dogs are not in danger of going extinct before humans are because humans consider dogs to be part of their households and families instead of parasites and predators to compete with for increasingly limited space on Planet Earth as human civilizations take up more space and consume resources at an exponentially growing rate. I don&#8217;t mean to suggest that humans should slow down their consumption rate, urban sprawl, or population size growth. Elon Musk, my leader, commands us to have more babies (and I think he is a smart man with godlike powers who is preparing a heaven on Planet Mars for humans to populate in addition to Planet Earth).&#8221;</p>
<p>B: &#8220;Are you suggesting we destroy Earth&#8217;s ecosystems because Elon Musk will give everyone a new planet to inhabit?&#8221;</p>
<p>A: &#8220;Not exactly. I think we need to accept that only a relatively small percentage of humans will survive the apocalypse which will be spurned on by ecological collapse and warfare over scarce resources. That&#8217;s just the timeless and inevitable law of natural selection at work. I advise all people to not worry about surviving long term and enjoy every day as though it were their last so that they don&#8217;t have an existential crisis.&#8221;</p>
<p>B: &#8220;I have to go. I&#8217;m being summoned into the next cyberspace partition by the clock detecting that midnight is approaching within ten seconds. Thank you and goodbye.&#8221;</p>
