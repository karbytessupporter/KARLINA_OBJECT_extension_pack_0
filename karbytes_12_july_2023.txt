I stopped applying for data entry clerk jobs once I saw that all the ones I saw posted other than the one I applied for seem to require licenses I do not have such as pharmacy clerk licenses and such jobs seem to be more customer service oriented than technology oriented. 

I started applying for more jobs which I thought sounded very similar to my most recent (paid) job as a package handler at the OnTrac warehouse in Fremont, California. I plan on driving to work until I get a better bicycle (if I think bicycling to work is feasible and not too much of a strain on me in terms of time and stress). I hope to have enough money saved (in the event that I am unable to use the car which I am currently borrowing or else I am unable to a bicycle I own to commute there) to pay for a Lyft or Uber ride to take me to work until I am able to resume using my primary commute method.

Today I researched that used electric cars typically sell for no less than $10,000 and are often less than $15,000. I am hoping that I can save up for such a car within the next three years by saving more money than I spend.
