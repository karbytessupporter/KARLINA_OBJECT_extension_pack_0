Today karbytes created an updated version of its resume and uploaded it to the GitHub repository which contains this note (and that resume file is named kar_beringer_resume_july_2023.txt). 

karbytes also replaced its current resume file on its Indeed dot Com profile with kar_beringer_resume_july_2023.txt and also created a Dice dot Com account featuring kar_beringer_resume_july_2023.txt.

karbytes started submitting job applications for various jobs starting yesterday including a contract data entry clerk job which is onsite in downtown Oakland near a BART station.

karbytes changed its LinkedIn profile description from Web Author to Information Technology Specialist and set its latest job from current job to being complete as of this month. (That job was not mentioned in kar_beringer_resume_july_2023.txt. Hence, that job description is mentioned in this note in the next two paragraphs).

I stopped applying for data entry clerk jobs once I saw that all the ones I saw posted other than the one I applied for seem to require licenses I do not have such as pharmacy clerk licenses and such jobs seem to be more customer service oriented than technology oriented. 

I started applying for more jobs which I thought sounded very similar to my most recent (paid) job as a package handler at the OnTrac warehouse in Fremont, California. I plan on driving to work until I get a better bicycle (if I think bicycling to work is feasible and not too much of a strain on me in terms of time and stress). I hope to have enough money saved (in the event that I am unable to use the car which I am currently borrowing or else I am unable to a bicycle I own to commute there) to pay for a Lyft or Uber ride to take me to work until I am able to resume using my primary commute method.

Today I researched that used electric cars typically sell for no less than $10,000 and are often less than $15,000. I am hoping that I can save up for such a car within the next three years by saving more money than I spend.

To be clear, if it is feasible for me to bicycle to my next job, then I will unless the weather is shitty or if I have urgent errands to complete within a small amount of time. Ideally, I would bicycle and take BART more than 95% of the time.

I have been using the Toyota Matrix as a storage bin to keep my clothes in (and I might also keep my backpack in there too and only take my phone, wallet, and keys with me in my cargo pants or jacket zipper pockets (with the bike lock fastened to the middle of the handle bars of the bike when I'm riding it). 

In the past I had issues bringing my big backpack to work because it was too big to fit in an employee locker and it was not allowed near the assembly lines because of limited space in those regions (so I was asked to leave it in the managers' office). 

A part of me is demanding I take the whole car with me to work more than 95% of the time so that I can have all of my stuff with me (which allows me to work on software engineering projects while waiting to begin my shift relatively close to where I work in terms of time and space) and so that I can leave my backpack in the car instead of take up an embarrassing amount of space inside the workplace.
