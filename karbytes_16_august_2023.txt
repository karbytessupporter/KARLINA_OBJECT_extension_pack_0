I just had one of the most intense "altered states of consciousness" experiences I have ever had within the past ten minutes (and that experience is still happening somewhat as I type this after going without sleeping during the most recent past 24 hours and consumed a relatively hefty dose of sativa tablets (and, to my embarasment and horror (or perhaps morbid and amoral curisosity), I listened for more than twelve hours of repeated loops of some creepy pig_gorl recordings I made which sound like some alien or altered parallel dimension of this human world speaking what now sounds like foreign and incomprehensible and psychotic and inhuman sounding noises). This is probably not worty posting.

The blurb in the previous section was written by me yesterday but I decided not to keep it online until today. I wrote that rather cryptic piece of "poetry" last night after sitting in the foul smelling dirt where stray cats live and leave their feces because that spot had some shade (but not much) and was within range of the public Wi-Fi (and I did not want to sit in the same area where other people were sitting). 

Today I feel like I got a much-needed mind-body upgrade after sleeping very soundly through the night on some nice flat concrete behind some bushes in a nearby corporate park. When I woke up I felt refreshed even though I also felt a bit short on sleep (and that sleep-deprived feeling is something I actually miss and associate with traveling, working, and otherwise having a more busy and fun-filled life than my "super saver mode" would have allowed).

Well, anyway, I got over my aversion to other people enough to actually enjoy sitting in the dining area at the Whole Foods Market in the shopping center I practically have been living at. It doesn't smell like feces in here (and there are not a bunch of feces-loving flies harassing me with their feces-caressing feet and stomachs which they project out of their mouths and onto whatever surface they are trying to digest). The temperature, humidity, fragrance, sunlight exposure, and availability of amenities is superb compared to my rather insane attempts to make a cafe of the feces-strewn dirt and desert shrubs which offered only a modicum of shade while offering lots of ants. 

The significance of that little blurb with the hash tags is that I caught myself "waking up" from feeling insane for at least a few consecutive weeks (and I was blaming other people and accusing them of trying to do me wrong when, in hindsight, I see that almost no one was ever trying to do me wrong and many people were just trying to do what they thought was fair (and I think they were totally justified in acting as they did but so was I)).

The significance of this little blurb is that I remember being able to spend hours inside of crowded cafes while using my laptop or drawing and I was more or less satisfied and productive doing so. I consider that to be essential as a "digital nomal": being able to thrive in public cafes and not just in secluded spaces. I think I may have over did it when it comes to secluding myself and it made me feel too cut off from human civilization to feel like a well-adjusted member of it. Now I feel like I am more or less back to my old self back when I was more of a student and tech employee. Travel sounds more appealing to me now than it did yesterday. What is losing appeal for me is writing in the first person about "personal stuff" like a teenage girl would. 

I am in a pretty good mood today and I am very grateful to have woken up in the right universe this time.

(By the way, I took a picture of the cafe I am sitting at right now as I type this note and update the section of Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com named RAW_GITHUB_FILES_MACRO_DIRECTORY. I uploaded that picture to this GitHub repository at the following Uniform Resource Locator (and that image has also been made into an Instagram post on my Instagram page)).
