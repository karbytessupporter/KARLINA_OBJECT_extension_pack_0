This note was created at approximately approximately 2:47PM Pacific Standard Time on 06_JULY_2023 by karbytes in Dublin/Pleasanton, California. The sky is clear blue, the air temperature is comfortably warm, and there is a moderately strong breeze. karbytes is happy to have discovered how to adjust the bike seat height such that karbytes is no longer in excruciating agony when peddling the bike while wearing a camping backpack full of gear which is arguably quite heavy. The bike (which is a Huffy Rock Creek bicycle whose tires are 24 inches in diameter) has a frame which is still a bit too small for karbytes to feel comfortable peddling up hills and going fast down hills on (because it feels like a top heavy jeep which could easily wipe out if karbytes makes too sudden of a turn or leans too far to one side). The bike is adequately comfortable for karbytes to call a commuter bike along flat ground and the tires appear to be decent quality mountain bike tires which can handle gravel, twigs, and other moderately sharp objects (unlike the commuter bike tires of past bikes karbytes remembers riding years ago). karbytes major next purchase is likely going to be either a cheap wagon or else an adult sized bike.

Within the next 24 hours I plan to put away two of the three Bike U-lock keys in a safe in my bedroom in case I lose the key to that lock which I intend to keep carrying on my person. I also intend to drop off the extra clothes which I do not need until it is time to attend a job interview. I also might grab one of the two identical surge protectors which I have stowed away in my room to carry with me so that I can charge all of my devices simultaneously using only one electrical outlet.

Within the past two hours I watched a very informative and morally significant video on Instagram in which the United States senator and former 2016 presidential candidate named Bernie Sanders speaks for approximately five to ten minutes on recent record breaking disasters related to climate change and the urgency for governments and people all around Planet Earth to take serious action on mitigating and reversing climate change. Within the next five hours I plan on downloading that video from Instagram, uploading it to the Internet Archive, and sharing that Internet Archive link on my Twitter, Minds, LinkedIn, and Patreon accounts.

The link to that Instagram video is as follows:

Rather than share the link to the video I uploaded taken from the Instram reel URL shared in the section above the three asterisks above this line of text, I decided to share the original Instagram reel URL on my Twitter and on my Minds pages but not on my other social media accounts. Also, I read that, if I lose the keys to my Bike U-lock, I might be able to get my bicycle free by calling a locksmith and having that person arrive onsite where my bicycle is located to pick the lock or to saw through it. I have called a locksmith once in the past over a decade ago when I could not start my car while it was parked in a parking garage because I did not have the key or the key tumbler was broken (and it cost about $300). I think that keeping the key to my Bike U-lock in a labeled plastic bag in that safe in my room should be sufficient for my needs. 

URL to the Instagram video which I downloaded and then uploaded to my library on the Internet Archive:

I realized that the Instagram video will only play for people who have Instagram accounts and are already logged into Instagram. Hence, I decided to share that Internet Archive link on my Twitter, Minds, LinkedIn, and Patreon accounts.
