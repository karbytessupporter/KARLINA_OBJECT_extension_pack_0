This note was created at approximately approximately 2:47PM Pacific Standard Time on 06_JULY_2023 by karbytes in Dublin/Pleasanton, California. The sky is clear blue, the air temperature is comfortably warm, and there is a moderately strong breeze. karbytes is happy to have discovered how to adjust the bike seat height such that karbytes is no longer in excruciating agony when peddling the bike while wearing a camping backpack full of gear which is arguably quite heavy. The bike (which is a Huffy Rock Creek bicycle whose tires are 24 inches in diameter) has a frame which is still a bit too small for karbytes to feel comfortable peddling up hills and going fast down hills on (because it feels like a top heavy jeep which could easily wipe out if karbytes makes too sudden of a turn or leans too far to one side). The bike is adequately comfortable for karbytes to call a commuter bike along flat ground and the tires appear to be decent quality mountain bike tires which can handle gravel, twigs, and other moderately sharp objects (unlike the commuter bike tires of past bikes karbytes remembers riding years ago). karbytes major next purchase is likely going to be either a cheap wagon or else an adult sized bike.
