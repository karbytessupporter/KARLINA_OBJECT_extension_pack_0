During the past two weeks I have eaten food from the Gotta Eatta Pita restaurant in Pleasanton which I used to work at (and I typically order a falafel bowl with a pita bread on the side and then I usually go to the Starbucks across the street to buy a large coffee to pair with the food). While in Dublin, I usually get most of my food from the Whole Foods Market though there are two Safeway's which are within a reasonable biking distance (but I found that Safeway is not significantly cheaper than Whole Foods Market is for purchasing the items I typically purchase). 

Last night I slept for approximately 3 hours on the other side of the tall cement wall of the narrow backyard with a fake green grass strip lawn in it and a large two story model home which used to be filled with furniture with light on at night (because that house was a model home but has since been emptied of its furniture and left dark at night) where I had the dreams I wrote about in the file which I recently added to this GitHub repository named unlisted_web_page_KARBYTES_JOURNAL_2022_ENTRY_220K.html. When I woke up this morning I saw some rather disturbing things next to me which seemed to fit the macabre themes of that area based on the dreams, shroom trips, and thoughts I had in that spatial region during the past two years: two furry white bunny feet attached to leg bones which were still wet and which looked like plant stems and pieces of a small skull and lower jaw with teeth in it. Last night I saw one of the bunny feet and thought it was a piece of the fresh lion's mane mushrooms I bought which I thought fell out of the plastic container they were purchased in. I lost my appetite for those mushrooms after seeing how close my stuff and my body was to those relatively fresh remains of a bunny. I did not them because I thought they might have become contaminated with germs from being exposed to many places I have gone which seemed a bit dirty along with the hot temperatures.

Speaking of hot temperatures, I remember a brief part of a dream last night which also seemed to fit the macabre themes I just described as yet another puzzle piece in whatever that "DMT space" puzzle is. I do not remember many of the details of last night's dreams (but I do remember having dreams that were quite eventful and emotionally significant). The part I remember which seems to fit what I think is most relevant for me to talk about (and then shut up about for a while) is global climate change caused by human activity (and other issues related to environmental and ecosystems stability as a result of detrimental human interference of such systems). I remember some callous cartoon character which appeared to be little more than a big talking mouth with big scary square shaped teeth saying, "It's not my air to breathe, so it's not my problem," seemingly in response to me imploring it to be more concerned about the welfare of its own children in regards to the worsening state of Earth's biosphere and that character's indifference and adamant denial that human activity is seriously detrimental to the Earth's biosphere and even to the survival of the human species. (I think that talking mouth was saying something about it not expecting to survive for more than seventy years and being glad to die long before the air becomes too hot and polluted to comfortably inhabit).

In "real life", I think that there is a disturbingly high prevalence of people (especially Americans) who staunchly deny that there are serious environmental issues caused by human activity (and I think such people are desperate to remain in a state of denial about how bad things really are so that they do not have some kind of very uncomfortable panic attack which seems to have no solution other than committing suicide quickly and without notifying anyone prior to committing suicide). Such people tend to be "too poor" or too dependent on belonging to certain kinds of social groups to adopt more environmentally friendly and animal welfare friendly practices. So rather than face up to how destructive their ways of life are to other sentient beings (including their own children and themselves), I think that such people would rather believe that climate change is a big fear mongering hoax implemented by liberal extremists because making environmentalists out to be silly caricatures makes it easier to dismiss such people as having nothing of value to say so that the people can go on merely polluting the environment, torturing and slaughtering animals, and perpetuating the marginalization of people who are not part of their privileged gated community oasises.

The world I woke up to this morning sort of looked like it was on a different planet in some creepy utopia where the people looked like generic robots by the way they moved without deviating from their stereotypical mechanizations (and the way there were so many rich, fit looking heterosexual couples with exactly one dog a piece like there were copy pasted with slight alterations) with reddish cirrus clouds covering large portions of the otherwise faint blue sky and large sprawling green lawns and smooth paved pathways near and through the park which was opened in September 2022 named Don Biddle community park. I don't mean to insult anyone. I'm merely pointing out what I observed and what I remember thinking and feeling at the time. I felt like an intruder hiding in the grass who people might have seen and knew was there (because I think people know about me and have an idea of what my habits and motivations are) and people seem to know that I am relatively harmless; just an alien doing its little field research projects passing through and collecting goodies along the way.

As I wrote this note, a little ladybug landed on my laptop and then it crawled onto my hand. I let the ladybug crawl off onto my water bottle. There are lots of little black ants traveling by but thankfully not very many have been traveling on me. Last night I remember seeing and hearing a lot of crickets.
