Yesterday karbytes finalized the website directory named KARBYTES_JOURNAL_2023_POST_BIRTHDAY of the website named Karbytes For Life dot WordPress dot Com.

Today karbytes updated the directory web page named KARBYTES_CODE_CONTINUES of the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com.

Yesterday karbytes was distressed by some facts it learned while watching a video of an interview downloaded from YouTube named "Marc Andreessen: Future of the Internet, Technology, and AI | Lex Fridman Podcast #386" about how professional truck drivers, on average, have a shorter life expectancy of approximately ten years than most other people as a result of being exposed to relatively high amounts of solar radiation and environmental toxins which are carcinogenic and stressful on the human body. karbytes was also worried about overexposing itself to such hazards as a result of spending so much time outside. 

karbytes has also been significantly distressed by being in the presence of other people so often (which makes karbytes want to look for a full-time warehouse job out in Livermore instead of a customer service job closer to Hayward such as cashiering or fast food service (and a warehouse job typically is impractical to commute to without a car due to long distances, strenuous physical labor involved in the job, and unreliability and lack of availability of 24 hour public transportation)).

For that reason, karbytes is planning on borrowing its parents' Toyota Matrix and using it to commute to a warehouse job so that karbytes can minimize its exposure to overcrowded, noisy, and polluted environments and minimize how much free time karbytes has outside of working. As soon as feasible, karbytes intends to buy its own 100% electric car such as a two-seater Smart car.
