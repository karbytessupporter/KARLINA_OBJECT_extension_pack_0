Am I a burden to society if I don't have friends. Apparently yes. But if I have friends, then I am a burden to those friends unless I give them benefits and never demand anything in return. I think having close to zero friends and practicing self reliance and spending a lot of time alone makes me a stronger, smarter, more original, and more self reliant person than I otherwise would be. Hence I think I should keep acting like a schizoid for the rest of my life. I might end up being voluntarily celibate and cuddle-free for the rest of my life too because I see how cruel and conniving people are and how they taunt me with things I want and seem to get pleasure from trying to prevent me from having such things. So rather than try to pursue such things, I would rather go without those things and only pursue the things I deem to be essential to thriving as a schizoid (i.e. someone who is extremely disinterested in being involved in intimate interpersonal relationships in favor of spending as much time as possible engaged in solitary activities).

I am not sure how many decades or years I will continue living for before I die. I consider myself to already be "too old" to make new friends (but I will have to have social connections in order to survive and to hold down a job). I will probably treat all of my future social interactions as mere isolated logistical transactions rather than as deposits or withdrawals from some kind of "relationship bank account". If I see the same person again multiple times, great! That person is then more or less a recurring character in the movie I am the sole protagonist of. Otherwise, that person is someone who appears zero or else one time throughout that entire movie.

I understand that I will probably not earn as much money nor live as long as a schizoid than as a non schizoid. That's the price I apparently "choose" to pay. Otherwise, I would "choose" differently. I apparently prefer to have autonomy and solitude more than I do attention, affection, and assets bestowed on me from other humans. Consequently, I think I need less money and less assistance than more socially enmeshed people do. I also think I am a deeper and more original thinker than they are.
