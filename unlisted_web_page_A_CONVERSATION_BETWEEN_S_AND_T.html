<p><strong>A_CONVERSATION_BETWEEN_S_AND_T</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>At approximately 3:42PM Pacific Standard Time (on 30_JULY_2023), karbytes came up with the following ideas (expressed as a dialog between fictional persons named S and T):</p>
<p>S: &#8220;When does bread turn to consciousness?&#8221;</p>
<p>T: &#8220;Before or after the bread is eaten by some sentient information processing agent.&#8221;</p>
<p>S: &#8220;Does the bread become sentience or does the sentience become bread (after that bread is eaten by a sentient information processing agent)?&#8221;</p>
<p>T: &#8220;A panpsychic worldview holder would likely say that sentience becomes bread. A molecular biologist would likely say that the energy stored in the molecules of the bread become the energy used to fuel the electrical signal propagation across multiple synapses in the brain (of the sentient information processing agent which digests the bread) simultaneously such that an emergent property of localized consciousness occurs such that it appears to itself to be localized to that particular brain within a larger encompassing space-time continuum (which that brain assumes through deductive reasoning that it is hallucinating its own instantiation such that it hallucinates its neurons and neuronal signal propagation into existence at the same time that it hallucinates the awareness of that fact).&#8221;</p>
<p>S: &#8220;A sentient information processing agent does not need to hallucinate a hardware brain into existence in order to be sentient (if panpsychism is true).&#8221;</p>
<p>T: &#8220;A sentient information processing agent needs hardware which consumes energy in order to implement some kind of algorithmic process throughout a space-time continuum. If that sentient information processing agent does not consume bread or otherwise gain usable energy inputs, that sentient information processing agent&#8217;s hardware would stop executing those algorithmic processes (including the process of brain-localized consciousness).&#8221;</p>
<p>S: &#8220;Perhaps that brain-localized consciousness will expand into some relatively non-localized (i.e. ubiquitous) consciousness if that hardware stops executing algorithmic processes as a result of starving to death or otherwise ceasing to function as a sentient information processing agent.&#8221;</p>
<p>T: &#8220;Perhaps that brain-localized consciousness will cease to exist forever (and it was the only unique instance of its class throughout the entire multiverse).&#8221;</p>
<p>S: &#8220;If you (a) define the multiverse as being the set of all imaginable phenomena and (b) you define every imaginable phenomenon as being inevitable to physically occur (infinitely many times) throughout (infinitely) many universes (but not in each possible to imagine universe throughout the entire multiverse), then that brain-localized consciousness is both alive and dead simultaneously from the perspective of a sentient information processing agent which is cognizant of the entire multiverse.&#8221;</p>
