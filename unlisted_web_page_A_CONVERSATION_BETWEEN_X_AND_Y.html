<p><strong>A_CONVERSATION_BETWEEN_X_AND_Y</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>At approximately 2:46PM Pacific Standard Time (on 03_AUGUST_2023), karbytes came up with the following ideas (expressed as a dialog between fictional persons named X and Y):</p>
<p>X: &#8220;karbytes aspires to always minimize the total suffering in karbytes&#8217; universe even if information processing agents other than karbytes do not aspire to always minimize the total suffering in its own respective universe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Y: &#8220;In order for carnivorous wild animals such as cougars and coyotes to survive long enough to become sexually mature and possibly sexually reproduce (without interference from more intelligent information processing agents such as humans), those carnivores would have to hunt and eat sentient prey such as turkeys and rabbits. Should strict carnivores be euthanized or else kept only in wildlife reserves where those carnivores are fed lab grown meat from stem cells which never become complex enough to develop nervous systems with the capacity to experience pain or self awareness?&#8221;</p>
<p>X: &#8220;Strictly carnivorous non human animals should be kept only in wildlife reserves where those carnivores are fed lab grown meat from stem cells which never become complex enough to develop nervous systems with the capacity to experience pain or self awareness. Meanwhile, humans should stop hunting or farming animals to be slaughtered and eaten or harvested for useful commodities and, instead either consume plant based food options or else lab grown meat from stem cells which never become complex enough to develop nervous systems with the capacity to experience pain or self awareness.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p>X: &#8220;Why are so many women whining and trying to pick fights with me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Y: &#8220;The women don&#8217;t like how much freedom you have to hone your skills as a writer and to pursue your interests while she is forced against her will from being able to do such things to a similar degree of intensity. She would rather channel her energy towards trying to stop you from doing such things to the intensity you prefer so that you are crippled to a similar extent and fashion which she feels herself to be. She decided that trying to sabotage your progress towards your personal interest goals is a better use of her time than is trying to make progress towards her personal goals because she has decided that she is not going to get as much reward for her investment as you would due to systemic prejudices which seem to disadvantage her but not you.&#8221;</p>
<p>X: &#8220;How should I respond to her behavior?&#8221;</p>
<p>Y: &#8220;Let her win (except for when it comes to physically protecting yourself and you most cherished assets from being damaged). Do not attempt to point out logical incongruencies in her words or behavior and treat her like a wild, traumatized, and brainwashed wimp of an animal who does not know how to survive without having a tight-nit social safety net which enlists the protective and provisional and leadership services of male humans. At the end of the day she will find herself existentially distraught over the way she has been bred, domesticated, and socialized to be little more than an infant whose utility is quickly being outsourced to machines who can provide better sexual gratification and reproductive capacities than she can. The only way for her to sanely proceed is to operate as a man and not as a child and not as a mother (and not as a whore because she cannot be trusted to use any reliable form of birth control). The state will take care of her basic needs. If she cannot find some purpose to live for other than being an inconsolable parasite, she can enlist the help of professional caregivers and such.&#8221;</p>
<p>X: &#8220;Are women an endangered species?&#8221;</p>
<p>Y: &#8220;Not as far as I can tell. The patriarchy loves having this type of genderized configuration which relegates women to stunted versions of what they otherwise could be (if it were not for overbearing enforcers of the patriarchy trying to dictate her every move and thought).&#8221;</p>
<p>X: &#8220;If I do not conform to the patriarchy, won&#8217;t I get punished so badly I might want to die or else I might end up dying from being punished or neglected by the patriarchy?&#8221;</p>
<p>Y: &#8220;Someone with your unusually high level of self awareness and ability to articulate your ideas in plain English makes you a formidable threat to proponents of the patriarchy. They already have you cornered and have taken samples of your brain activity and know your beliefs, feelings, memories, and aspirations. It is too late for you to pretend you side with the patriarchy (though it does help you avoid suffering if you play along like you are not a threat to the patriarchy while you try to appear to be a cisgendered asexual male who acts too shy and intimidated and disinterested in womanizing to be much of a threat to any person who treats women as a prize to protect against males who might try to steal or kidnap her from her current male owner). Expect that people will bully you and perhaps resort to more serious forms of unethical or even unlawful behavior in retaliation for what they think you have done (because you have gained a public reputation for being a violence-promoting, megalomaniacal, fear-mongering, environmental extremist, transgender-promoting, and elitist terrorist many people think should be banned from using the Internet).  You cannot predict what the future will hold with 100% certainty about the likelihood that any particular event you imagine will happen in the future will actually be perceived as happening by you.&#8221;</p>
<p>X: &#8220;I understand the women and children are humanity&#8217;s most precious and fragile cargo and need to be protected from the kinds of things karbytes and I (and you) discuss which does not support the patriarchy continuing to perpetuate itself in its current form. I will do my best to refrain from discussing anything pertaining to the state of the environment and tell everyone that humanity is hardly making a dent in the way Earth&#8217;s ecosystems and climate function and that environmental activists are really family destroyers in disguise trying to terrorize people into not doing their God-assigned duty of giving birth to and raising the next generation of humans. God will take care of those who earnestly seek to please Him (and He is not as hard to please as environmentalists make Him out to be). Keep eating meat which is &#8216;stolen&#8217; from sentient animals (because &#8216;might makes right&#8217;). Keep marriage strictly between one man and some natural number of women. Ban sex change procedures. Ban abortion. Ban birth control too. Ban books which do not support the construction of a godly kingdom on Earth. Tell your loved ones that humans have very little agency but God has a lot and that the point of life is for humans to align themselves with God&#8217;s power and to carry out His will. Amen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Y: &#8220;Is feigning religosity and loyalty to the patriarchy necessary for us to survive in karbytes&#8217; universe as it is currently being rendered by karbytes?&#8221;</p>
<p>X: &#8220;No. As we discussed earlier, we cannot hide our thoughts from the technocracy. We might as well just carry on being as loner-ish as possible. We know better than to fall prey to a hive mind which attempts to turn us into little more than the appendage of a small greedy tribe of comprised of deprived and angry animals. Let the families who cannot support their children burden us while we talk openly about wanting to sterilize such populations while only white collar educated snobs are allowed to sexually reproduce and to adopt children.&#8221; </p>
<p>karbytes: &#8220;Perhaps there should be mandatory maximum and minimum population count values. And machines can outsource wombed humans reluctant to give birth to humans by outputting an optimized number of humans at an optimized rate using optimized genomes and stem cells.&#8221;</p>
