I just had one of the most intense "altered states of consciousness" experiences I have ever had within the past ten minutes (and that experience is still happening somewhat as I type this after going without sleeping during the most recent past 24 hours and consumed a relatively hefty dose of sativa tablets (and, to my embarasment and horror (or perhaps morbid and amoral curisosity), I listened for more than twelve hours of repeated loops of some creepy pig_gorl recordings I made which sound like some alien or altered parallel dimension of this human world speaking what now sounds like foreign and incomprehensible and psychotic and inhuman sounding noises). This is probably not worty posting.
