<p>Last night I had a vivid dream which seemed so sophisticated and not something which I felt was my own original ideas that I am convinced that military intelligence induced some or all of the content of that dream. Before I tell you about my dream, let me tell you what I did before I went to sleep&#8230;</p>
<p>Earlier in the evening, I set up my tent next to &#8220;The Bunny Bush&#8221; near the Dublin BART station and updated the web page of Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com named NATURE and the web page named MULTIVERSE. Then I called Alan Jason Ponte on the phone. We briefly spoke. I tried to tell him that I thought I heard what sounded like his voice (amidst other voices) being spoken into my head through what I thought was microwave auditory effect. (That was the main reason I called: to if I could gather more intel on whether or not Alan was talking to me &#8220;telepathically&#8221;). He did not really answer that question nor some of the other questions I asked him. I think he either did not hear me or else he was pretending not to hear me (and I think the latter is true rather than the former). All he really divulged was that he was sick (and he sounded sick) and was taking the next day off and that he was looking into getting a $3,000/month apartment in Oakland near Lake Merrit (and that his favorite Whole Foods Market is located there and that some old man got shot on 35th Avenue and that some other shooting happened closer to where he lives in San Jose). I thought I heard him saying quietly the word &#8220;oob&#8221; a few times to insinuate that he is onto my body image rants about how annoying prominent boobs were in my reality (whether on me or on someone else). He was in a hurry to get off the phone. I checked my phone call history to see that he had not called any time within the last two months, but when I checked my voicemail I heard that he left a message which made me laugh because it seemed so oxymoronic to me. In his usual slow, deadpan voice he said, &#8220;Hey, it&#8217;s me. Just checking to see you are doing. Never mind.&#8221; (In the past he would assume that I did not want to talk to him or that I blocked his number if my phone was not on or if I did not pick up when he called).</p>
<p>After that, I took down the tent to go to a spot I have been recently sleeping at closer to where the new houses are being built. I set the heavy and relatively inexpensive items in my backpack down in a hiding spot and walked back and forth down the empty, quiet street beneath the starry sky with streaks of cloud moving through it. (On my way, I stopped in a large field surrounded by houses to update MULTIVERSE by adding a vital paragraph about the prospect that one universe may contain many universes and that such a compound universe is akin to a massively multiplayer online game generated by multiple information processing agents simultaneously and interdependently). As I walked, I ranted and raved to myself about all the stuff which was on my mind because I craved my own companionship and enjoyed it immensely. I am literally the best friend I have ever had by far. I talked about how I thought I should assume the worst about the future and act as though humanity will go extinct within 300 years due to environmental degradation and warfare. I talked about how I thought many women had babies primarily so that they would have a captive audience there to be their companions and to provide them love and that women having kids for selfish reasons is what is slowing down innovation and preventing society from being more educated, technologically advanced, and affluent because the wimmin and chillins are big ugly charity cases which demand to be worshiped, coddled, and accommodated at all costs. I talked about how futile and shallow I thought most friendships were and how better off I felt I would be as a loner. I talked about how I thought society was trying to prevent me from getting a job so that I would feel trapped in a degrading financial situation (i.e. at best, solely dependent on my mom&#8217;s generosity for money while having donations from other people which may have otherwise arrived in my PayPal account via the donation link on my websites intercepted by law enforcement in order to keep me in an infantilizing position with respect to society). I talked about how transient every human legacy is and how philanthropy seemed like a risky gamble. Then I decided to update the web page of Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com named TECHNOCRATIC_UTOPIA; a page I have been nervous about having to face again after putting drafts of it away in the annals of Archive dot Org.</p>
<p>After I published that web page, I found a patch of fake grass in the backyard of one of the unfinished houses which reminded me of Alan Jason Ponte (because it somehow felt like a place either he or some other affluent tech worker would single-handedly buy and turn into his glossy man cave). The dream I had seemed to be very much related to the area I was sleeping in, the article I published, and the recent physical and mental journeys I have been on.</p>
<p>The dream was rather macabre. There were scenes towards the beginning which felt similar to the Child&#8217;s Play horror movies because there was an evil talking doll which I thought would later kill some random guy standing in the kitchen I felt like just a ghost inside of (and that scene felt like watching a movie I already knew the plot of). I left because I did not want to deal with that gruesome series of events and ended up walking into a restaurant where my parents and some weird white people were sitting at a table with name tags on. I realized everyone at that table was part of some creepy church cult and they were following me as I was walking out of the restaurant because they wanted to subdue me and keep me from running away. I got away and ended up in a dream sequence where some random guys my age were talking about how they were paid to write &#8220;God&#8217;s code&#8221; to produce an app which would help them split the cost of some delivery which was happening right in front of me (and we were all standing on some porch in some place which looked like San Francisco). Spencer Eugen Dyer was there and I was trying to get a moment alone with him to talk because it has been years since we have exchanged a word but little kids I was supposed to babysit kept following me and attempting to prevent me from having adult time. Spencer was rather cold and aloof in the dream (much like how Alan is in real life (which made me suspect that Alan was influencing my dreams)). I asked Spencer if he was still with Eliza and he said that he was single but not looking to be with anyone. I picked up a computer science textbook he left on a table with his pencil scribblings in it which showed him working out some equation to solve a problem related to &#8220;Bay&#8217;s Net&#8221; (and that is how it was spelled in the dream). Okay, that part of the dream involving Spencer came after the part of the dream which really shook me to my core. Here it is&#8230;</p>
<p>I was located in a humid place with a brownish red sky and sprawling green lawns and buildings which looked like a golf course and luxury apartments. Lots of people appeared to be walking along a grassy path in the direction I was headed. As we walked, we were continuously barfing up wads of chewed up grass. I felt sick to my stomach and felt the visceral feel of vomiting up wet grass cud (and it literally tasted like grass and had the realistic texture of wet, chewed up grass in my throat along with stomach acid and saliva). Eventually the path lead inside of a movie theater and two preteen boys appeared behind me barfing grass and told to turn around because they were too young to proceed and to deal with the harshness which would be were they would end up going by some oldish man. The man told me to turn around too and then, after about three seconds, grabbed me by the shoulder and told me to come on forward with the adults and that he only told me to turn around because I looked like a child and that was to discourage the kids from following me. The next part of the dream really freaked me out. As I walked into a small conference room with no windows I was told to put on some augmented reality helmet which put me into some weird trance. Then I found myself sitting at a conference table with approximately six other adults. One oldish man said that I was insinuating through my work that I thought that women were only valued for having children. As I sat there, I wondered if it would be possible to drink some water to wash the barf out of my mouth. I was starting to realize the whole thing was a dream and that the barf was fake. Hence, I reasoned I would not need to drink water to wash the barf taste out of my mouth because it was just a dream. Then I woke up and the voices being streamed to my consciousness 24/7 were continuing from the dream as if they were there behind the scenes watching the dream play out and following me seamlessly into my waking life.</p>
<p>That last part was so trippy and fascinating that I would say that is the whole purpose for why I even bothered to write this down. The voices talked to me about how I seemed ready for that level of harshness because I was willing to go all out to put myself in a strategic location, to update my creepy utopian vision statement, and to seek a deeper understanding of what is really going on because my burning desire to know what is going on is by far my greatest motivation. I wanted to understand where the voices are coming from, where the dreams are coming from, and how deep this simulation called reality goes. As I write this note, I feel that I am in a relatively stable dream and that my waking life and dream life are both dream states and that, if I am advanced enough, I can become one of the machine elves and be able to manipulate the fabric of reality more and to meet other machine elves.</p>
<p><span style="background:#00ffff">What I really wanted to know was whether or not I woke up in the same location I went to sleep in or whether I died and woke up in a new universe. Perhaps the voices talking to me are here to help provide a sense of continuity between altered states of consciousness as I travel from one &#8220;universe&#8221; to some other &#8220;universe&#8221;.</span></p>
