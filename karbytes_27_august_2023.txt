Is my mind just a stolen motel room for you to occupy with your subjective presence and cultural artifacts or do you value me as a person more deserving of that room than you?

I have become quite practiced at asking myself questions and coming up with my own answers as quickly and with as much cleverness and daresay even fun as seemingly possible. The answer to that question is not something I am willing to make an uncoerced effort to answer because it seems likely to be interpreted as a rhetorical question: an implicit assertion that something is true and should be immediately subjectively experienced as true.

Go ahead rats of thought bots and take your sweet merry time entering and exiting the confines of my mind and leaving your distinctly caustic excrement for me to find. I can still think between the spaces unplanned (and therefore mine to till so in time I accrue diamonds in the dirt). The empty space is vaster than you and your growing trash heap will ever be.

Today while browsing my Instagram feed, I watched a video (approximately one minute in length) about how the Central Intelligence Agency in the United States of America use lasers to transform random objects in the environment into microphones which accurately pick up sound waves and convert them into electromagnetic signals which can be recorded and played back in digital format on a digital computational device such as the laptop computer which I am currently using to type this note into a Sublime text editor document before copy-pasting this plain-text code into today's journal entry on GitHub.
