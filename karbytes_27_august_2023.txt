Is my mind just a stolen motel room for you to occupy with your subjective presence and cultural artifacts or do you value me as a person more deserving of that room than you?

I have become quite practiced at asking myself questions and coming up with my own answers as quickly and with as much cleverness and daresay even fun as seemingly possible. The answer to that question is not something I am willing to make an uncoerced effort to answer because it seems likely to be interpreted as a rhetorical question: an implicit assertion that something is true and should be immediately subjectively experienced as true.

Go ahead rats of thought bots and take your sweet merry time entering and exiting the confines of my mind and leaving your distinctly caustic excrement for me to find. I can still think between the spaces unplanned (and therefore mine to till so in time I accrue diamonds in the dirt). The empty space is vaster than you and your growing trash heap will ever be.
