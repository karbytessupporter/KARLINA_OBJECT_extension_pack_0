<p>This morning I had some very disturbing dreams which seem to be continuing off from previous dreams I have had but forgot. Before I describe the dream, let me begin by saying that, in real life, I have noticed the following disturbing trends: personal belongings of mine which I do not remember discarding nor removing from my room have somehow gone missing over the years. I also noticed that my father had a weird obsession with stowing my old personal belongings (including science text books) up in his attic. I also have noticed that, years ago when I used to sleep in that room at my father&#8217;s house, I would seem to not wake up on time for job interviews even after setting my alarm. I remember one scene where I woke up at exactly 9AM on the dot and my father was just standing right outside my room like he was glad to see me miss my job opportunity. One time when I blurted out to him that I thought he was preventing me from having a job and I was leaving, he followed me outside like I said the disturbing truth that he previously and since has pretended to be in denial of: that he and possibly my mother and possibly friends of his have been colluding against me to prevent me from having a job, friends, and the ability to travel freely and to truly leave them because they want to keep me &#8220;kid sized&#8221; mentally for their fetishistic amusement and as part of some kind of fountain of youth cult. I have a dreadful feeling that some of the voices I hear in my head are literally my parents talking into my skull (especially my father&#8217;s voice). I also have a dreadful feeling that my parents have invited people to come over to knock me unconscious and to do examinations and surgeries on me (and/or they erased my memories of such events). I have decided not to talk to my parents about these matters because, in the past when I did, they threatened to evict me (and I do not think they want me to get much further than the psychiatric ward and being in the police&#8217;s custody for life).</p>
<p>Anyway, onto the dream&#8230;</p>
<p>I was at my old house and was attempting to go from pretending to be moved back in to my old room to sneaking out to resume living outdoors as I have been in real life for the past two to three years. On the way out the door, some guy my parents&#8217; age was heading up the driveway to visit and he said, &#8220;You look so angelic.&#8221; I thought he was creepy but tried to be polite and did not stop walking. Somehow I woke up again in my old bedroom. When I tried to leave again, my mom yelled and my dad stood at the doorstep with a remote control device in his hand which caused a giant hidden garage door to come down (and it literally sped up as soon as I started running to make a break for it). That giant garage door seemed to come out of the sky. I also felt myself getting sleepy as a result of some kind of remote control interference as I tried to climb the fence south of the property. I struggled to stay awake and to find some way around the obstacle but, again, ended up waking up in my old bedroom.</p>
<p>Other events occurred within that dream which were also disturbing but not nearly as disturbing as the details I just described.</p>
<p>I feel pain and dread over my missing rock collection, marble collection, and box full of nostalgic artifacts which I suspect may be in that attic at my father&#8217;s house or maybe even my mother&#8217;s house. I must admit that I think they deliberately tried to reinforce the idea of me having a crippling disability by turning my old room into a sick person&#8217;s room. A giant bed with a remote controlled headrest takes up most of that space and a single wooden chair faces that bed like it is designed to resemble a visitor coming to visit a bedridden person in a hospital. They painted over the artwork and coloring I used to have on those walls with a dull beige and someone else&#8217;s artwork. I do not really feel loved by my parents (<span style="background:#ffff00">*</span>). I think they only invest in me to keep me as their doll and/or to avoid liabilities and/or because the government is in on the charade and is secretly trying to keep me &#8220;kid sized&#8221; in terms of what my options and worldview is so that I can be used as a &#8220;frozen in time&#8221; novelty against my will as some kind of tourist attraction; a human bonsai.</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00">(* I did not mean to imply that my parents do not love me. My definition of love is probably not the same as most people&#8217;s definition of love is. While most people seem to think love is synonymous with feeling a sense of affection and/or attachment to a particular object, I think that love has more to do with investing in some object&#8217;s integrity, welfare, and freedom. To me, love has more to do with allowing a person to be itself rather than owning a person or with associating with a person. I suppose I would say, &#8220;I cherish your continued evolution and flourishing,&#8221; instead of, &#8220;I love you,&#8221; because, &#8220;I love you,&#8221; to me sounds like, &#8220;You are an asset in my collection of cherished objects. For that reason alone, your welfare is relevant to me&#8221;).</span></p>
<p>I must add that, as far back as I can remember, I have always felt extremely old (like as old as the universe) and as mature as I am now even as a child. I have felt that I emerged from mysterious and ancient void and that my human parents are not my true origin point even if I am their biological offspring. What I am trying to insinuate is that I am an alien living in a human&#8217;s body or, at the very least, someone who has been woke to the fact that I am living inside of some kind of very finite simulation since I was very young. I feel like my oldest friend. I feel that the &#8220;little me&#8221; emerged from, is still fundamentally identical to, and in communication with the &#8220;big me&#8221;. Since I was young I felt that the &#8220;big me&#8221; was my realest parent. It has a certain kind of voice and presence which seems more wise, old, and disembodied than mere humans are. That &#8220;big me&#8221; seems to be loving but invisible and not easy to notice especially now that I am older and now that my life and mind is more complex and data intensive than it was while I was as a child (and as a child, I remember everything feeling like a hologram amidst a ubiquitous darkness encompassing all things in my reality).</p>
