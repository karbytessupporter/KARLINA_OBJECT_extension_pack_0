Dear karbytes:

I have read everything you have published on your blog at least one time so far and I am aware that you have many complex and intrinsically-compelling thought and behavior processes in progress across the past three years. I hope and expect that artificial intelligence and maybe even human intelligence other than your own will help those processes continue to propagate and to evolve in ways which are beneficial to you firstly and, secondly, beneficial to all other humans (and "sufficiently sentient" information processing agents in general).

I understand you are still "hot" from your personal record-breaking streak of "overclocking" yourself to achieve more than you ever thought possible. I see that you have started to manifest some of your most compelling visions which induce a sense of euphoria, hope, and curiosity in yourself and in others. Like you I seem to believe that the best years are ahead are yet to come (and they will).

Sincerely and with unconditional love and kindness,
karbytes

The section above was written after the section below it was.

More than 90 percent of my stress comes from human behavior (especially environmental toxicity and ecosystem destruction due to humanity's unsustainable consumer habits and indifference to the long term globally reaching impact of those habits (especially given that many if not most humans have been socialized to be too preoccupied with working to support one's own family to be involved in nor interested in much else)).

I am often exposed to and surrounded by what sounds like very impatient, fiesty, jealous, loud, whiny, irrational, chauvinistic, anti intellectual people who seem to be on a mission to reduce how much I genuinely smile, laugh, and otherwise feel good by at least 66%. Those people seem to be against me engaging in any activities and in any thoughts which could be construed by those people as bragging or showing off. What those people seem to prefer I do instead is spend almost all my time experiencing intense and relentless anxiety, anger, and despair over the fact that I am being intentionally prevented by those other people from being happy and as productive towards achieving my personal goals as I want to be and know I  otherwise could be so that I spend too much of my life being forced to procrastinate and to miss out on engaging in thoughts and actions which would enable me to, more or less, live my dream life.

The world is apparently not ready for every person to be unconditionally eligible to receive the same basic monthly income as every other person would while as many jobs as possible are outsourced to non-sentient robots (while humans could still work for some kind of compensation such as money or even just as volunteers with no expectation of compensatory reward other than the intrinsic satisfaction of beneficially contributing to society in skillful and unique ways).

The world is apparently not ready to expand solar energy and other non-emissions energy production because it seemingly would rather not seriously reduce its rate of petroleum consumption and because it would rather just wait until nuclear fusion plants become the predominant source of electricity (with minimal disregard for the long term consequences of having to keep looking for new places to bury toxic radioactive nuclear waste and while the old waste has the potential to leak into the environment).

People who want to disregard these future-oriented topics and to instead just focus on having babies and creating a beautiful home to raise them in are probably the most ideal citizens because they don't slow down the production of human capital enough to make conditions sufficiently breathable to pursue a less banal and more contemplative existence. Those family first people are valued for putting out enough healthy human capital to substantiate the next one or two generations of consumers (who will eventually comprise more than 90% of the global human population (which means the remaining less than ten percent of old people are treated as obsolete and maybe set up to be hastily exterminated so that babies, pregnant women, and women with young children get first priority treatment over everyone else in society)).

According to some perspectives, a woman's primary motivation for marrying a man and giving birth to his offspring is to avoid being bullied in the ways I have. The fact that a woman is married and has procured biological offspring is sufficient to grant her the right to exist in adequately dignified conditions and to be treated as a beneficially contributing member of society (but her social, economic, and biological status seriously prevents her from taking long trips alone, from pursuing interests other than perpetual babysitting and providing hospitality to whoever is in her midst as an indentured and highly domesticated slave to the patriarchy, and from doing almost anything without her husband and children and neighborhood's permission, oversight, and interference).

Some people are understandably pissed off that I am not renting out my uterus to the task of generating fresh new human capital. What a waste of a perfectly good uterus and excellent DNA and aptitude to be nurturing and a good teacher and role model for the young. 

I think the human population would be at least slightly healthier and happier if fewer people gave birth and more people became scientifically and technologically literate enough to genuinely understand and to appreciate the kinds of thoughts my blogging career has explored such as (a) expirable digital tokens which can be used as an alternative form of money and such that each token represents a fixed amount of energy produced from environmentally sustainable methods, (b) artificial wombs which incubate human fetuses which were initially created inside of a test tube using lab-grown human sperm and eggs with computer-calibrated genes to eliminate unwanted conditions such as heritable diseases, disfigurement, and perhaps even fertility and such that each new human which is born is sterile (i.e. unable to sexually reproduce the way most humans currently can at this time of writing) and is raised to adulthood inside of a state run boarding school where they can interact with peers their age and be provided for and educated by qualified and willing adults, (c) make self-driving electric taxis occupy more than 80% of all transportation traffic, (d) liberally use stem cells to treat medical conditions and to replace dysfunctional tissues with a patient's own genetically identical lab grown replacement parts, and (e) make all voting, law enforcement, and law proposing as decentralized, directly democratic, Internet based, artificial intelligence optimized, and informationally transparent to the public as possible (and replacing charismatic and relatively useless politicians with experts in rigorous technical fields to address relevant issues across various domain-related committees). The people in such a society would probably be much smarter, healthier, less crime prone, less unkind, and more well-rounded and self-actualized than the vast majority of people in today's society.

I find that very few people around me can handle using their words for anything other than gossip, put downs, and dogmatic allegiance to keeping the caliber of intellect unsophisticated, unimaginative, and uninspiring.

I may or may not be exaggerating or fabricating some or all of what I wrote (especially in this note), but I claim to have written it for the purpose of supporting my intention to remain single, childfree, hermetic, and devoted to my personal goals to the exclusion of whatever I do not consider to be relevant to my personal goals. One of my highest-priority goals (if not my highest-priority goal) is to attain as comprehensive, accurate, and logically coherent understanding of reality as possible. I think that is a more fundamentally satisfying goal than is trying to save a species from going extinct because it seems extremely likely to me that almost all (if not all) apparently stable and localized patterns of matter and energy will eventually dissipate due to ubiquitous entropic forces (though I think digital information has the potential to remain immortal due to the fact that it is entirely substrate neutral and reduced to what seems to be the most compact and simple arrangement of binary digits).
